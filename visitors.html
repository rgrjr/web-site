<hr>

<p>Out of curiousity, I recently started looking at what software people
use to visit my Web site.  For the period 1 June through 18 August, I
got around 2000 hits that specified a "user agent" field.  (This
effectively excludes worms, which generally don't bother with full HTTP
headers, but doesn't exclude Web robots.)  I ran these headers through a
script that built a histogram of browser and OS usage frequencies, after
throwing away the cryptic details (e.g. browser build and Linux kernel
version).  I then did some manual consolidation of similar categories,
e.g. over similar operating system versions.

<p>For browsers, the basic breakdown is as follows:

<blockquote>
<table>
  <tr><th>Browser</th> <th>Hits</th> <th>Percent</th></tr>
  <tr>
    <td>MSIE</td> <td align=right>1472</td>
    <td align=right>71&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Mozilla (Netscape)</td> <td align=right>527</td>
    <td align=right>25&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Konqueror</td> <td align=right>51</td>
    <td align=right>&nbsp;2.5</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Opera/6.x</td> <td align=right>16</td>
    <td align=right>&nbsp;0.8</td>
  </tr> 
  <tr>
    <td>other</td> <td align=right>9</td>
    <td align=right>&nbsp;0.4</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Total</td> <td align=right>2075</td>
    <td align=right>100%</td>
  </tr>
</table>
</blockquote>

The "Mozilla" and "other" categories undoubtedly include some search
engines, many of which advertise themselves as "Mozilla-compatible."
(So does MSIE, for that matter.)

<p>The versions of Internet Explorer seen included 4.x (27 hits)
5.0..5.2 (331), 5.5 (478), and 6.x (636).  So people must not be in any
hurry to upgrade their browsers.  One can only hope they are not so
casual about updating with security patches.

<p>Even more interesting is the mix of operating systems people used,
which breaks down as follows:

<blockquote>
<table>
  <tr><th>OS</th> <th>Hits</th> <th>Percent</th></tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Linux</td> <td align=right>406</td> <td align=right>20%</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Mac_PowerPC</td> <td align=right>43</td>
    <td align=right>2.1</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>SunOS</td> <td align=right>43</td> <td align=right>2.1</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Windows</td> <td align=right>1517</td>
    <td align=right>76&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Total</td> <td align=right>2009</td> <td align=right>100%</td>
  </tr>
</table>
</blockquote>

<p>Given that my site has "Linux" plastered all over most of it, I find
it astonishing that more than three-quarters of you all are running
Windows.  Perhaps this is the search-engine equivalent of "sorry; wrong
number"?

<p>Within the Windows camp, I notice that there are many people who
haven't upgraded their OS in some time:

<blockquote>
<table>
  <tr><th>Version</th> <th>Hits</th> <th>Percent</th></tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Windows 95</td> <td align=right>57</td>
    <td align=right>3.8%</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Windows 98</td> <td align=right>480</td>
    <td align=right>32&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Windows NT/2000</td> <td align=right>975</td>
    <td align=right>64&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Windows XP</td> <td align=right>5</td> <td align=right>0.3</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Total</td> <td align=right>1517</td> <td align=right>100%</td>
  </tr>
</table>
</blockquote>

<p>The NT figure also includes 108 users of Windows&nbsp;NT&nbsp;4.0,
for which Microsoft dropped support in early 2002.  It also includes 636
users of Windows&nbsp;NT&nbsp;5.0, which may be an alternate moniker for
Windows&nbsp;2000.

<p>I can understand that there are Windows&nbsp;2000 users who don't
want to be bothered with XP, which appears to be even less popular than
I had heard.  And Windows&nbsp;95 is getting extremely old now, for an
OS, but maybe these people are using old hardware that doesn't support
the newer OS versions, or doesn't run them fast enough.  But
Windows&nbsp;98 is widely regarded as the flakiest OS ever released by
Microsoft -- and that's saying something.  I had a brief experience with
Windows&nbsp;98, and found it quite painful, even when I was only using
it as a virtual terminal to dial in to the "real" computers at work.

<p>Windows&nbsp;Me is conspicuous by it's absence, but maybe it
advertises itself as something else within the MSIE "User-Agent:"
string, perhaps Windows&nbsp;98.  A similar effect may also explain the
low count of Windows&nbsp;XP users.
