<h2>Why I use TMDA to reduce spam</h2>

<p><a href="/"><tt>Home</tt></a> : <a href="index.html">Stuff about

<hr>

When you send me email for the first time, you will encounter the <a
href="http://tmda.net/"> Tagged Message Delivery Agent (TMDA)</a>, which
is the spam-filtering system I use.  Specifically, you will be asked to
reply to a confirmation request before the message is actually delivered
to me.  When you confirm, the original message is dropped into my inbox
(i.e. you do not need to resend it), and your address is added to my
"whitelist" of approved senders so that you won't need to confirm
messages in the future.  (Unless, heaven forbid, I decide you are a
bozo, and move you to my blacklist.)

<p>I apologize for the inconvenience of making legitimate users jump
through an extra hoop in order to send me mail, but I consider this a
reasonable price to pay for not having to wade through literally
hundreds of junk messages that arrive at my addresses each day,
or put up with the inevitable errors that a
content-based filtering system would make.  At least you only have to
confirm once, as opposed to making sure that none of your "Subject:"
lines ever have the words "viagra", "oxycontin", "investor alert",
"enlargement", . . . or any likely misspellings of the foregoing.

<p>The beauty of whitelisting as opposed to content-based antispam
solutions is that it insists merely that each sender use a valid return
address, yet it is astonishingly effective.  The reason it works so well
is that spammers don't want to be caught by using a working return
address, so they make them up.  (Besides, who would read something from
"Joe Sleazebag <tt>&lt;js@spammer.com&gt;</tt>"; email from "Lana Sexpot
<tt>&lt;oohbaby@willing.org&gt;</tt>" stands a much better chance of
being seen.)  But I don't care to read mail from anybody who doesn't
want me to be able to reply, so I lose nothing.

<p>But sometimes a spammer uses somebody's real address as the return
address for a batch of spam.  That's called "backscatter," or sometimes
a "joe job."  I've only been the "joe" once, getting 17,000 messages in
the space of 12 hours, and it was not fun.  If this ever happens to you,
you will get tons of bounce messages for spam sent to people who changed
their email
address, probably to get away from the spam, and a few confirmation
messages from people like me who use <a href="http://tmda.net/">TMDA</a>
or similar systems.  If you get "joe-jobbed" and want to <a
href="contact.html">get in touch</a> with me,
I'd be happy to move you to my
blacklist so that spam that uses your forged address is simply dropped,
but this will only stop the confirmation requests that come from my
addresses.
