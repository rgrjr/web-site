OK, so I'm not all that vain.

<h3>Web hacks</h3>

<ul>
  <li> <a href="/cgi-bin/bob/ra.cgi">Find "ratio anniversaries" for two
       birthdays</a>.  These are dates when the ratio of the two ages
       (measured in days) are closest to some small integer fraction,
       like 5/3 or 3/4.  In detail, here is what this script does:
       <blockquote>
       Given two birth dates, find all ratios <i>p/q</i> such that
       <i>age1/age2&nbsp;=&nbsp;p/q</i>, where <i>p</i> and <i>q</i> are
       integers between 1 and 10 (with some extra whole-number multiples
       thrown in if the ages are very different).
       </blockquote>
       I wrote this page on impulse, finishing it on the last day of
       2004.  It occurred to me that Anna and Lizzie were turning 10 and
       5 respectively in the summer of 2005, and that Anna would
       therefore be twice as old as Lizzie some time during the year.  I
       used this page to find the exact date (the girls want to have a
       party), and then discovered that I would be ten times as old as
       Lizzie in March, and five times as old as Anna on 3-Jan-2005!
  <li> <a href="/cgi-bin/weather/weather.cgi">Local weather</a>.  This
       is incomplete, and not very smart.  I would like to extend it to
       provide more history, use the Weather Service data directly, and
       provide an interface for more locations, but I haven't been
       sufficiently motivated yet.

<h3>Useful links</h3>

I tend to prefer these sites because, along with whatever other reasons
I had for picking them originally (like really working), I've taught my
<a href="../linux/squid.html">Squid Web proxy/cache</a> to filter out
the advertising images they use.
