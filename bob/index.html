<h2>Bob Rogers: the vanity pages</h2>

  <li> <a href="resume.html">My resume (abbreviated edition).</a> </li>
</ul>

<p>OK, so I'm not all that vain.  (I used to have pages for my
daughters, so I could post cute kid pics.  But I haven't updated those
in ages, and now the older of the two is in grad school, and the younger
is working on an acting career.  So now they have lives -- and Facebook
pages -- of their own.)
