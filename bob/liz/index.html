Elizabeth Emma Rogers officially joined the human race at 12:15 on
the morning of 14 July 2000, weighing 8 lb 14&1/4 oz (4.03kg).  Mother
and baby were both happy and healthy immediately after the birth; Dad
was happy but dead tired, having not had more than four or five hours
sleep in the previous few nights.

<p>While Jan and Liz were still in the hospital, Anna kept telling us
that she is "very excited" to have a new baby sister, and couldn't wait
for baby Liz to come home.  Anna met her new sister that very afternoon,
and it was wonderful to see the two of them together, even though all
Liz did was sleep.  We took some cute pictures of Liz sitting on Anna's
lap while Anna was sitting on mine.  (This was actually Anna's idea; one
of Anna's friends has such a picture.)  I have a feeling that Anna is
going to turn out to be a terrific big sister.  Liz doesn't know it yet,
but she's very lucky.

<p>Liz was born via elective Caesarian section, since indications were
that the baby might weigh 10 pounds or more, with the associated risk of
complications for both mother and child if Jan had decided to go for a
vaginal birth.  If Liz's estimated weight, 4468g plus-or-minus 20% (!),
had been just 32 grams higher, the doctor wouldn't have even given her
the choice.

<p>We're all very glad that the waiting is over, and we can hold and coo
over our newest daughter.  (Now I have to reprogram my head to stop
talking about "my daughter" and say "my older/younger daughter" instead,
use plurals, etc.)

<h2>Diapers in the dark</h2>

<p>Around two o'clock in the morning, shortly after Liz turned one month
old, I was changing her diaper when there was a power failure.
Fortunately, I had finished wiping by that time, but it was pitch dark.
Since Liz usually gets changed on the rug in the dining room, I didn't
want to go get a flashlight, because I was afraid I might step on her
(though if I found the flashlight, and it still worked, the return trip
wouldn't be so much of a problem).  And if I picked her up and carried
her, bare buns and all, I might bump into something with her, or she
might decide to cut loose on the way -- you decide which is worse.
Well, OK, bumping the baby is worse, but Liz has already surprised me on
more than one occasion, and it's enough of a pain to clean up after even
when it's light and the mess is confined to the changing area.

<p>So, while still in the dark, I felt around for a new diaper, hoping I
had remembered where I put the old one, and wrapped it around the punkin
buns and taped it by braille.  By then, my eyes had adjusted to the
trickle of light coming in through the drapes, so I picked Liz up, and
we managed to get to the flashlights without bumping either of us.

<p>No sweat for an experienced dad, eh?
