<h2>Employment history</h2>

<p><b><a href="http://www.esstech.com/">ESS Technology</a></b>,
Kelowna&nbsp;BC Design Centre (satellite office), May-01 to Mar-02.
<ul>
  <li> Continued development of the <a
       href="http://rgrjr.dyndns.org/icancad/">ICanCAD</a> schematic
       editor, bringing it to full schematic editing functionality.
       ICanCAD is focused on mixed-signal IC circuit design (i.e. both
       analog and digital signals are "mixed" on the same integrated
       circuit).  ICanCAD 0.2.0 boasts the following features:
       <ul>
	 <li> Rich visual feedback during schematic entry.
	 <li> An "Undo/Redo" stack of arbitrary depth.
	 <li> Support for parameter passing from hierarchical parent to
	      child.  A single schematic can thus be used to represent a
	      whole family of layouts that share a common circuit
	      topology.
	 <li> A special <a href="/icancad/schematic.html#wires">"speed
	      wiring hack"</a> for wiring many series connections with a
	      single click.
	 <li> Plus a number of other special features to speed design
	      entry.
       </ul> 
       Release 0.2.0 consists of nearly 27K lines of Common Lisp source,
       plus 10K lines of HTML documentation.
  <li> Extended the <a href="/emacs/">Discus</a> package (<a
       href="#bu-discus">see below</a>) to support secure symmetric
       directory mirroring via <a href="http://rsync.samba.org/">
       <tt>rsync</tt></a> or <a
       href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=scp">
       <tt>scp</tt></a>.
  <li> Built my own office network (wiring, hardware, and software) to
       support a dual boot Linux/Windows PC and an AlphaStation DS10
       running Tru64 Unix, with the virtual <a
       href="http://stony-brook.scrc.symbolics.com/www/">Open Genera
       2.0</a> system on top of Tru64.  The network has four computers
       running a total of five operating systems (six, if you count Red
       Hat Linux as distinct from SuSE Linux).  The main machine runs
       number of <a
       href="http://rgrjr.dyndns.org/linux/howto.html#servers">
       servers</a> to support the various satellite machines (<a
       href="#linux">details below</a>).
  <li> Studied Virtual Private Network (VPN) technologies, especially <a
       href="http://www.freeswan.org/">FreeS/WAN</a>.
  <li> Provided Linux, X11, and OpenSSH support to Kelowna and the
       Fremont CA headquarters.
</ul>

<p><b><a href="http://bmerc-www.bu.edu/">BioMolecular Engineering
Research Center</a></b> (BMERC), Boston University, Feb-94 to May-01.
<ul>
  <li> <a href="http://bmerc-www.bu.edu/psa/">Protein Structure Analysis
       (PSA) server</a> for protein structure prediction using designed
       Hidden Markov Models (HMMs); nearly 40&nbsp;000 protein structure
       predictions have been made since Fall 1994.  Designed and wrote
       the mail server in <a
       href="http://www.cs.indiana.edu/elisp/elisp-intro.html"> emacs
       lisp</a> as a front end to a structure analysis tool written by
       <a href="http://www.jvwhite.com/">J.&nbsp;V. White</a> and
       C.&nbsp;M. Stultz in the <a href="http://www.mathworks.com/">
       Matlab language</a>.  Took over maintenance of the <a
       href="http://bmerc-www.bu.edu/psa/request.htm">Web interface</a>
       in early 1998.  Assumed front-line responsibility for maintaining
       the Matlab code in late 1999 (and wrote a dot-m-file parser in
       Common Lisp in order to analyze the code).  Consists of 6.3K
       lines of emacs lisp (the server proper), 1.7K lines of perl
       (server support and CGI interface), 4.6K lines of Matlab .m
       files, and a few hundred lines of miscellaneous shell scripts.
  <li> Codeveloper of the <tt>needle</tt> protein structure prediction
       toolkit.  42K lines of Common Lisp (the majority of which was
       originally designed and written by <a
       href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~rickl/">Richard H. Lathrop</a>),
       plus 2K lines of C.
  <li> Wrote the <a
       href="http://bmerc-www.bu.edu/needle-doc/"><tt>needle</tt> tools
       software</a> suite for manipulation of and extraction of
       statistics from entries in the <a
       href="http://www.rcsb.org/">Protein Data Bank</a>, a flat-file
       protein structure database; used as support software for
       <tt>needle</tt>.  7.7K lines of perl, 9K lines of C, 600 lines of
       <tt>csh</tt> scripts, and 13.8K lines of HTML documentation.
       (Much of the C code was inherited, but has been completely
       rewritten in the process of extension.)  The source code for all
       scripts (perl and <tt>csh</tt>) is browsable at <a
       href="http://bmerc-www.bu.edu/information/script_frame.html">
       <tt>http://bmerc-www.bu.edu/information/script_frame.html</tt></a>.

       <a name=bu-discus>
  <li> Wrote the <a href="/emacs/">Discus</a> package for symmetric
       directory mirroring via FTP.  Discus consists of 5K lines of
       emacs lisp, and has been used to support the distributed
       development of <tt>needle</tt> since 1994.
  <li> Designated site <a
       href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/emacs.html">emacs</a>
       wizard.  Responsible for emacs upgrades on the three principal
       BMERC system types (SunOS 4.1.4, Solaris 7, Tru64 4.0).  Wrote
       more than 10K lines of emacs lisp to support HTML editing and
       various other uses, some of which is published as <a
       href="http://bmerc-www.bu.edu/needle-doc/emacs/rgr-hacks.html">
       <tt>rgr-hacks</tt></a>.
  <li> Assisted our sysadmin while she installed <a
       href="http://www.umich.edu/~rsug/netatalk/">
       <tt>netatalk</tt></a> on two Solaris servers.  Designer and
       principal implementer of our site-wide <a
       href="http://www.qmail.org/"> <tt>qmail</tt></a> upgrade
       strategy.  Advisor on security issues; shock-trooper on security
       emergencies, such as the <a
       href="http://www.cert.org/advisories/CA-2000-13.html">
       <tt>wu-ftpd</tt> "SITE EXEC" fiasco</a>.
</ul>

<p><b>Silicon Analog Systems</b>, Kelowna BC, Canada, part-time
consulting during Jan-00 through Mar-01.
<ul>
  <li> Developed <a href="/icancad/">a prototype analog IC CAD
       system</a> in Common Lisp.  After seven weeks (FTE) of design and
       implementation work as of Mar-01, ICanCAD 0.1.3 consists of about
       9K lines of Common Lisp and 3400 lines of HTML documentation.
       ICanCAD 0.1.3 is capable of viewing existing schematics (produced
       by a legacy CAD system), and is starting to show some limited
       editing functionality.  Work has been done on producing <a
       href="http://edif-tc.cs.man.ac.uk/">EDIF Version 2&nbsp;0&nbsp;0
       Level 0</a> output, but a complete implementation requires <a
       href="/icancad/busses.html">full electrical connectivity
       semantics</a>.  ICanCAD runs on <a
       href="http://www.franz.com/">Allegro Common Lisp</a> using CLIM
       graphics, and on <a href="http://www.cons.org/cmucl/">CMU Common
       Lisp</a> (without graphics).

       href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/emacs.html">emacs</a>
       usage and <a href="http://www.scriptics.com/">Tcl</a> regular
       expressions, and helped people design and debug their Tcl, SQL,
       and HTML as they worked their way through the problem sets.
  <li> Wrote some <a
       href="http://bmerc-www.bu.edu/needle-doc/emacs/">emacs help
