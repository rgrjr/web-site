Humor : "Damon Mahler"

<p><i>I persuaded an Internet acquaintance of mine to send me the
following anecdote, received in an email dated 28 March 2000, which I
reproduce below along with his gloss, and only minor editorial and
HTMLization changes.  If he recognizes himself, he is welcome to claim
credit for forwarding this tale, but for now, I'll keep his identity
quiet, lest someone trace it back to the author.  (The author is unknown
to me, by the way.)  Enjoy.  -- Bob</i>

<blockquote> Okay, here's the tale from my friend. He has requested that
he be identified only as "my friend who works at an HTTP mail provider",
since he has an NDA and a job to protect.

<p>The rest of this . . . is his text.  Along with his final-line
claimer of truth, I can personally vouch for the fact that he's been
telling this story since about six or seven months ago, and does work at
such a company -- this is *not* urban legend.

Here's what happened.  One afternoon, I was in the process of helping a
customer on the phone.  She was sending email to her friends and none of it
was getting through from her Mailprovider account, and 'AOL is a
<i>lot</i> simpler 
than this'.  <i>Oh, boy</i>, think I. <i>Another Asshole On Line.</i>
We speak for a while, and a while longer -- she's describing the steps she
goes through sending her email.  Unfortunately, everything she's doing is
right!  I'm not finding any huge errors in her interactions with our
interface.  Finally, in desperation, I ask her to spell out the email
address of her friend, Jane Doe.  She tells me 'It's spelled
J-A-N-E-space-D-O-E'.  Just as I'm realizing that she's been leaving off our
friend, the <tt>@domain.foo</tt>, I ask her if she has been getting any
messages to 
tell her that her mail has been bouncing.  "No, I haven't. So I know it
went."  I'm thinking she's got to be lying, and checking in our records -- sure
enough -- there are 4 <tt>mailer-daemon</tt> notices in her account.  As
I'm about to 
ask her about them, she says -- and I quote -- "And I keep getting all
this spam from some illiterate named Damon Mahler. He can't even spell
his name right."

<p>Pressing the mute button, I snickered, then pressed it again. As luck would
have it, she <i>could</i> be online while we were on the phone, so we accessed
her account and I had her read the address off the email --
M-A-I-L-E-R-dash-D-A-E-M-O-N-at-mailprovider-dot-com.  I ask her why she hasn't
opened them, and she says -- again, I quote, this one's just etched into my
brain -- "Well, my friend told me that they have viruses in them."

<p>More mutebutton.  More hysterical laughter.  We're now approximately
25 minutes into the call.  I convince her to read one and she reads off
our friend, the qmail 'no domain, you doof' message.  I explain the
<i>entire</i> message to her, line by line, until she understands what
the message means. She thanks me profusely, I explain to her what an
email address is and how you need to include the whole darn thing.  We
hang up.

<p>HOWEVER --
this isn't the end of our sordid tale.  About 2 hours later, I'm in the
middle of lunch.  Of course I am. One of my co-workers comes in to tell me
she's called back to complain about Mailer-Daemon closing her account.  And
she WON'T tell him about it, despite me suggesting she do so. So fine.  I
put my damned sandwich down, and pick up the frigging phone.  First thing I
do is ask if I may log into her account and have a look.
Here is what happened, in terms that you and I will understand.
She put <tt>JaneDoe</tt> into the 'To:' field again.  No <tt>@</tt>, no
<tt>aol</tt>, no <tt>.</tt>, no <tt>com</tt>.
Just <tt>JaneDoe</tt>.  Just like I told her not to do.
And of course, Mailer-Daemon came back with 'What the hell are you talking
about?' -- along with 'this is a permanent error, I've given up trying. Sorry
it didn't work out.'
So she <i>replied</i> to <tt>Mailer-Daemon@mailprovider.com</tt>, saying
<blockquote>
Mr. Mailer, I'm sorry -- I'm new to the Internet, and I don't
understand what I'm doing.  Can you please try again?
</blockquote>
NOW -- here comes the really funny part.  when you write to
<tt>mailer-daemon@mailprovider.com</tt> you get a bounce (of course);
for some reason, at the time, that bounce message was a 554 (I forget
off hand) saying the addressed account had been closed for abuse.

<p>She read this -- HALF AN HOUR AFTER HER TUTORIAL ON EVERY GODDAMNED
LINE IN THE BOUNCE MESSAGE -- and assumed Mailer-Daemon was telling her
he'd closed her account.  Never mind that she also somewhere got the idea
that Mailer-Daemon was a human being.

<p>I swear to you all that this is true.
