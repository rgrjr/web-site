<h2>How to get in touch with me</h2>

<p><a href="/"><tt>Home</tt></a> : <a href="index.html">Stuff about
me</a> :  Contact information
<hr>

<p>If you want to contact me, email is the most reliable technology, and
is often quicker than telephoning.  Be aware that if you have never sent
me an email before, you will need to <a href="tmda.html">reply to a
confirmation request</a> from my anti-spam system.
<ul>
  <li> Home email:  <tt>&lt;rogers@rgrjr.dyndns.org&gt;</tt>.  I prefer
       to receive email at this address; it is the swiftest and most
       reliable of the ones I have.  An alternative is
       <tt>&lt;bob@rgrjr.com&gt;</tt>, but I get poorer service at this
       address.  Both are protected by <a href="tmda.html">TMDA</a>.
  <li> If you happen to know one of the throwaway email addresses I use
       to subscribe to mailing lists, feel free to use it, just don't be
       surprised if I've thrown it away, which I will do when it starts
       collecting spam.
  <li> Home phone:  781-646-9215
  <li> Here's my <a href="rogers-2003.text.asc">current PGP public
       key</a>; you will need this if you want to send me encrypted
       messages.  (See <a href="http://www.gnupg.org">
       <tt>http://www.gnupg.org</tt></a> for more information.)
  <li> Mailing address:  If you need this, please send email to the
       home address above.
</ul>
