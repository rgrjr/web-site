<h2>How to get in touch with me</h2>

<p><a href="/"><tt>Home</tt></a> : <a href="index.html">Stuff about
me</a> :  Contact information
<hr>

<p>If you want to contact me, email is the most reliable technology, and
is often quicker than telephoning.
<ul>
  <li> Home email:  <tt>&lt;rogers@rgrjr.com&gt;</tt>.  I prefer
       to receive email at this address; it is the swiftest and most
       reliable of the ones I have.  An alternative is
       <tt>&lt;rogers@rgrjr.dyndns.org&gt;</tt> (but they both go to the
       same place).
  </li>
  <li> Home phone (land line):  781-646-9215. </li>
  <li> Mailing address:  If you need this, please send email to the
       home address above.
  </li>
</ul>
