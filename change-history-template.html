: Recent changes
<hr>

<p>This is a summary of changes made to my Web site in the last 90 days,
presented as a chronological digest of CVS revision history entries.  It
is updated approximately as often as I change pages.  The information is
extracted automatically from CVS, so even though I may forget to run it
now and then, what it shows will always be complete.

<p>(I thought of making this look at the CVS log dynamically, so that
users could choose how much detail they wanted to see, but that would
have required giving the Web server write access to the CVS repository,
which I decided wasn't worth the bother.)
