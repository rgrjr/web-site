<h3>General</h3>

<a name="time">
<h4>When and where is the course?</h4>

<p>It will be held Saturday and Sunday the 18th and 19th of September,
at Quincy Quarries in the Blue Hills Reservation, Quincy, Massachusetts.
Instruction will begin promptly at 8:30 AM, rain or shine, transitioning
into toproping in the afternoon as time and weather permit.
</p>

<a name="benefits">
<h4>What are the benefits of taking this course?</h4>

<p>In addition to meeting fellow outdoor climbing enthusiasts, you will
learn to set up toprope anchors using natural and other clifftop anchor
points, and to clean bolted anchors.  Furthermore, students who graduate
from this program will be invited to join the AMC's Fall Frolic climbing
weekend in the Gunks September 25-26.  While most of the climbing there
is multipitch "trad" (i.e. requiring gear placement), the Gunks has
toproping opportunities in a beautiful setting with world-class
climbing.  This is one of the reasons why you should want to learn to
climb outdoors.  See <a
href="https://www.mohonkpreserve.org/visit/activities/climb.html">the
Mohonk Preserve</a> (which owns the land) and <a
href="https://gunksclimbers.org/">the Gunks Climbers Coalition</a> for
more climbing info.

survey must be completed by Sunday, August 22.
</p>

<a name="fee">
<h4>Is there a course fee?</h4>

<p>Yes, $10.  Scholarships are available.  Payment will be required
after your application is accepted.  You will be notified some time
after the application closing date on Sunday, August 22.  Those who are
not accepted will be wait-listed in case of cancellations prior to
September 10.
</p>

<a name="refund">
<h4>Under what circumstances could I get a refund?</h4>

<p>[tbd]</p>

<a name="gear">
