<h2>Hardy Mountain/Red Rocks</h2>

Rte. 133.  Left (north) on 133, under 128, park immediately on left.

<p>A well-marked trail runs south parallel to 128 for about 1/3 mile to
a trail/gully leading right into the woods.  (It is also possible to
walk along 128 next to the guard rail; leave the roadway and rejoin the
trail at the "no parking" signs.)

<p>There are several sets of rocks -- the trail bends to avoid the
first, a short cliff visible through the trees -- but the most popular
is a 5 minute walk up the shallow gully to cliffs on left.  (<a
href="#bbd">BBD!!!</a>)

<a name="nahant">
<h2>Nahant Sea Cliffs</h2>

Fort Ruckman on Big Nahant Island, Nahant.  From Rte. 1 and 128 north,
Rte. 129 toward Lynn and Swampscott.  After 6-7 miles on 129, cross
Rte. 1A in Lynn at a traffic light (ocean straight ahead).  Toward
ocean, right (south) on Lynn Shore Drive, to rotary.

<p>From Boston, over Tobin bridge (I95) or through Callahan tunnel
(Rte. 1) to Rte. 107 north.  Cross marshlands, enter Lynn, pass General
Electric on right.  1/2 mile to large 5-way intersection.  Right on
Common St., around Common, right on Commercial St.  Left on Lynnway,
follow signs to Nahant and the rotary, and as above.

<p>From rotary, cross causeway to Nahant.  Owing to parking restrictions
in Nahant, park in beach parking area at end of causeway near the Tides
restaurant, shuttle to cliff, last one takes his bicycle.  If you arrive
late and are willing to risk a ticket, directions to the cliff follow:

<p>From Little Nahant Island, keep going for 0.3 to 0.4 mile, and turn
right onto Castle Road.  Within about 0.5 mile, there will be two
schools on the left with parking.  Continue on Castle Road to where it
goes off at a sharp right; make a left onto Gardiner, and then a sharp
right onto Trimountain.  Follow Trimountain to the bottom of the hill,
and take a left into the parking lot (by permit only).

<p>Hike to cliffs along paths.  Watch out for poison ivy!  Major
rockfalls in 1991 have significantly reduced climbing opportunities
here.

<a name="r1q">
<h2>Route 1 Quarry</h2>

Route 1, Lynnfield.  From Boston, Rte. 1 north, pass Walnut St., park on
right at Bowling alley before Rte. 129.

<p>From 128, take exit for Rte 1 south to Walnut St.  Reverse direction at
cloverleaf then as above.

<p>Walk around left side of buildings, past piles of rubbish until in
back of buildings. Pass through fence, follow road into forest, hillside
on left, wetland on right.  1/10 mi to first climbing area up hill on
the left (hard to see).  Contour right, from first crag to Second crag.
Right uphill past old VW Bug fender, over hill and descend toward Third
area on left in an abandoned quarry. The most interesting climb here
(Pizza and Beer) is finger crack in the vertical wall in left side of
quarry.  This area is particularly confusing for first timers so don't
be shy about asking someone to show you around.

<p>Although the foregoing seems the easiest access, an alternative
approach exists:

<p>North on Rte 1 (1/4 mile south of 128), right (east) on 129, pass Ledge Rd,
second on right.  At rotary, take 129 east toward Lynn Swampscott Hospital.
First right just past sign "Goodwins's Clam Shopppe". Park in commuter
parking lot opp. Goodluck Farms and Clam Shoppe. Walk back (west) 1/2
mile along sidewalk on left side of Rte. 129 to Ledge Rd. To end of Ledge
Rd. (1/4 mile), road branches slightly left.  Follow dirt road for 1/4
mile to reach Third crag on right.  Continuing on dirt road, take faint
trail right down talus slope past old VW Bug fender.  First and Second
crags are up hill to the right.

<h2>Mt. Spickett, Burrill Hill Tower, and Johnson Crag and Boulders</h2>

<a
href="http://maps.yahoo.com/py/maps.py?&addr=Great+Woods+Rd&csz=Lynn+MA">
Great Woods Rd., Lynn Woods, Lynn</a>.  North on Rte. 128 (I95) or north
on Rte. 1, take exit for Rte. 129 east, Lynn (do not mistake for
Rte. 129, Wakefield).  From rotary, 1 mile to Atlantic Medical Center on
right, another 0.6 mile to Great Woods Rd. on right; Lynnfield
St. Baptist Church is on the corner.  Right on Great Woods Rd. to the
end, past stone pillars, park at end by ball field.

<dl>
  <dt> Burrill Hill Tower:
  <dd> <span style="color: red;">Note:</span> Climbing is no longer
       permitted on this decaying structure.  Follow dirt road past
       gate on left side of reservoir for 1/3 mile, left at junction,
       uphill to tower.  Avoid side roads or trails.

       <p>
  <dt> Mt. Spickett:
  <dd> Follow dirt road along right side of reservoir for 1/4 mile.
       Cliffs on ridge to right.  (<a href="#bbd">BBD</a>)

       <p>
  <dt> Johnson Crag:
  <dd> Follow dirt road as for Tower.  At 5 minutes, just before road
       junction, go left (southeast) on well-worn trail (Cornel Path)
       winding through woods.  At 6 minutes, do not take trail on right.
       At 7 to 8 minutes, trail turns passing near golf course on left,
       then small ledges on right near edge of Breeds Pond Reservoir.
       At 15 minutes, pass two large boulders in reservoir near shore.
       (<a href="#bbd">BBD</a>)

       <p>(Ed note: This area has been renamed in memory of Bob Johnson,
       who explored and put up all the original routes here.)

       <p>
       <dl>
	 <dt> Forest Castle
	 <dd> Look right for and follow faint trail marked by cairns.
	      At 18 minutes, reach the base of the south-facing cliff.

	      <p>
	 <dt> Small Cliff
	 <dd> Continue to follow hiking trail west from the 15-minute
	      mark.  At 17 minutes, head up right to small cliff that
	      faces north.

	      <p>
	 <dt> Johnson Boulders
	 <dd> Go to right end of Small Cliff.  Follow stone wall
	      southwest for 2-3 minutes to first boulder.  Gain top of
	      boulder on west side.  Other boulders are northwest of
	      this.  If at other boulders or lost, shortest time back to
	      parking area is to go straight up hill until reaching
	      Boulder Path.  Go right onto trail and follow it uphill
	      until reaching tower at top of Burrill Hill.  Continue
	      straight ahead down dirt road back to parking area.  (<a

<h2>General Notes</h2>

<ol>
  <li> We usually begin to gather between 5 and 6 PM. 
  <li> There has occasionally been some problem with vandalism at some
       of the parking areas.  It is suggested that you leave nothing of
       value visible in your car.
  <li> Setting up adequate top rope anchors at some of these areas may
       require some ingenuity.  Bring plenty of sling material, or extra
       rope.  Climbing protection is often useful.

       <a name=bbd>
  <li> "BBD" means "Bring bug dope."
       <a name=lpr>
  <li> "LPR" means "Long pants recommended."
