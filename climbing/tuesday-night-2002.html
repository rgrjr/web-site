<h1>Tuesday Night North Shore climbing schedule</h1>

<p><a href="/"><tt>Home</tt></a> : <a href="./">Climbing</a> :
Tuesday Night schedule
<hr>

<p>This is a semi-official activity of the <a
href="http://www.amcboston.org/comm/mountaineering/"> Boston Chapter
Mountaineering Committee (BCMC)</a> of the <a
href="http://www.amcboston.org/"> Boston Chapter</a> of the <a
href="http://www.outdoors.org/"> Appalachian Mountain Club (AMC)</a>.
Those of us who work and live on the North Shore find it hard to get to
the Quincy Quarries for the traditional after-work Wednesday climbing
events, so we have our own tradition of Tuesday night climbing.  Since
there are no large climbing areas within an easy drive, we rotate the
location among <a href="directions.html">a series of smaller sites</a>
according to the following schedule.  Everyone is welcome, including
beginners, but we cannot provide safety instruction, so if you are not
confident of your belaying skills, please bring your own instructor.

<p>Please bring your top-rope gear (ropes, long slings, and anchor
stuff; small wires or camming devices may be helpful at some of the
crags).  We often retire afterward to a nearby watering hole for beer
and sustenance.

<p>When it rains on Tuesday we sometimes try to regroup at the same
location on Wednesday.  Those with less flexible schedules sometimes
meet at the <a href="http://www.bostonrockgym.com/">Boston Rock Gym</a>
the same night.  Alternate plans are often discussed on
<tt>climbing&nbsp;<i>at</i>&nbsp;rgrjr.dyndns.org</tt>, including
whether the rain has stopped early enough to make it worthwhile.  In any
case, there is always climbing at the Quincy Quarries on Wednesdays (if
it dries up in time).

<h2>Footnote: Lynn Woods access</h2>

<p>As of a few years ago, climbing on Lynn Tower requires advance
permission from the appropriate town committee.  (The restriction may or
may not apply to Lynn Woods generally; we hope to clarify this shortly.)
We had obtained permission to climb Lynn Tower when this rule went into
force, but due to a miscommunication, we were unaware that we needed to
renew our permission each year, and did not find this out in time for
the 2&nbsp;July date.  Consequently, we have had to move the 2&nbsp;July
climbing venue to Hammond Pond, pond area.

<p>We apologize for the inconvenience, and hope we can secure permission
for Lynn Tower in time for 17&nbsp;September, the next scheduled Lynn
Tower date.  Please be sure to check this page for updates before
showing up at the Tower on that day.

<h2>Update: Lynn Woods access</h2>

In the event, we failed to secure permission to climb Lynn Tower.  The
consensus of the Tuesday Nighters who showed up at Black and White Rocks
on 10&nbsp;September was to replace Lynn Tower with an additional night
at Black and White Rocks.  The thought was that nobody who was unable to
make the 10&nbsp;September date would be likely to complain that there
were too many B&amp;W nights, and none of those present objected.  And
the sooner the decision was made and publicised, the better.
