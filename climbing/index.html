       Wednesday nights and (usually) Sunday mornings.  We use the list
       to organize outdoor climbing day trips on the weekends.

  <dt> Local rock gyms:
  <dd> These are the nearby ones that I visit least occasionally:
       <ul>
	 <li> <a href="https://www.metrorock.com/boston/">MetroRock</a>,
	      69 Norman St, Everett; 617-387-7625.  It's an older
	      facility, but it has plenty of space and great variety of
	      terrain, and lots of friendly people.
	 </li>
	 <li> <a href="https://www.centralrockgym.com/stoneham/">
	      Central Rock Gym</a>, 10 Adam Rd, Stoneham, 781-438-2905.
	      I used to be a member, and it's a brand new facility and
	      nice enough, but it's much too small for someone who wants
	      to climb 3-4 times per week.  I also visit their <a
	      href="https://www.centralrockgym.com/watertown/">Watertown
	      location</a>, which is larger, but often much more crowded
	      (at least it was pre-Covid-19).
	 </li>
	 <li> Alas, my all-time favorite was Boston Rock Gym, which
	      closed in January of 2019.
	 </li>
       </ul>
       Eastern Massachusetts is well supplied with rock gyms; for a
       fuller listing, see the <a
       href="http://www.indoorclimbing.com/massachusetts.html"> page for
       Massachusetts</a> at <a href="http://www.indoorclimbing.com/">
