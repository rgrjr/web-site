<h1>Tuesday Night North Shore climbing schedule</h1>

<p><a href="/"><tt>Home</tt></a> : <a href="index.html">Climbing</a> :
Tuesday Night schedule
<hr>

<p>This is a semi-official activity of the <a
href="http://www.amcboston.org/mountaineering/"> Boston Chapter
Mountaineering Committee (BCMC)</a> of the <a
href="http://www.amcboston.org/"> Boston Chapter</a> of the <a
href="http://www.outdoors.org/"> Appalachian Mountain Club (AMC)</a>.
Those of us who work and live on the North Shore find it hard to get to
the Quincy Quarries for the traditional after-work Wednesday climbing
events, so we have our own tradition of Tuesday night climbing.  Since
there are no large climbing areas within an easy drive, we rotate the
location among <a href="directions.html">a series of smaller sites</a>
according to the following schedule.  Everyone is welcome, including
beginners, but we cannot provide safety instruction, so if you are not
confident of your belaying skills, please bring your own instructor.

<br><center><b>[Draft 23-Mar-05]</b></center>

<h4>Draft notes</h4>

<ol>
  <a name="note1">
  <li> I haven't yet decided what to do with 6 July, since we no longer
       have permission to climb at Lynn Tower.  (The two other Lynn
       Tower dates are now an additional B&amp;W date and the "Climber's
       choice" on 30 Aug.)
       <a name="note2">
  <li> "Climber's choice" on 30 Aug is an experiment.  The location will
       be decided by popular vote (tabulated by yours truly), and
       announced in mid-August.
</ol>

<p>The descriptions in the "LOCATION" column are linked to directions on
the <a href="directions.html">
<tt>http://rgrjr.dyndns.org/climbing/directions.html</tt></a> page.  Or,

<blockquote>
<i>Climbing Directions<br>

</blockquote>

<p>Please bring any top-rope gear you many have (ropes, long slings, and
anchor stuff) in addition to your personal climbing equipment (shoes,
harness, and belay device).  Small wires or camming devices may be
helpful at some of the crags, if you have them.  In any case, bringing
top-rope gear is not necessary, especially if you are willing to help
others set up and take down their gear.

<p>Since most people come directly from work, the earliest arrivals are
at 5:00 or 6:00, depending on location and traffic.  Climbing continues
until around sunset, with takedown during twilight (sometimes later; see
<a href="ephemeris.html">the ephemeris</a>).  Afterwards, we usually
retire to a nearby watering hole for beer and sustenance.

<p>When it rains on Tuesday we sometimes try to regroup at the same
location on Wednesday.  Those with less flexible schedules sometimes go
to the <a href="http://www.bostonrockgym.com/">Boston Rock Gym</a> on
rainy Tuesdays.  Alternate plans are often discussed on the <a
href="lists.html#climbing">
<tt>climbing&nbsp;<i>at</i>&nbsp;rgrjr.dyndns.org</tt></a> mailing list,
including whether the rain has stopped early enough to make it
worthwhile.  In any case, there is usually climbing at the Quincy
Quarries on Wednesdays.
