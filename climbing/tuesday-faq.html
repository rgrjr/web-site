<h2>Boston Climbing:  Frequently asked questions</h2>

<p><a href="/"><tt>Home</tt></a> : Climbing resources
<hr>

<h4>Q:  How do I join the Tuesday Night group?</h4>

A:  Just show up and introduce yourself; there's no formal notion of
"joining."

<h4>Q:  I don't have my own top rope equipment ...</h4>

A:  That's OK, as long has you have your personal gear (shoes, harness,
belay device).  Since most people have ropes, but only half can be
climbing at any one time, we usually have more than enough ropes.

<h4>Q:  When and where do you guys usually meet?</h4>

A:  The directions on the <a
href="http://rgrjr.dyndns.org/climbing/directions.html"> "Directions to
top-rope areas"</a> page for the Tuesday crags will take you right to
the crag we climb on.  Usually, we are pretty obvious -- the largest
group, if not the only climbers present.  Since most people come
directly from work, the earliest arrivals are at 5:00 or 6:00, depending
on location and traffic.

<h4>Q:  What do you think is the best option to meet other
climbers in the Boston Area?</h4>

A:  If you can get out of Boston, the <a
href="http://www.bostonrockgym.com/gym/">Boston Rock Gym</a> is a great
place to meet people.  There's a commuter rail station about a half mile
away, and an express bus from Haymarket to Cummings Park, which is about
a half mile on the other side, but no other public transit to speak of.
<a href="http://www.gravityrockgym.com/">Gravity Rock Gym</a> is easier
to get to by the T, but I haven't yet visited myself.

<p>In good weather, there's usually a crowd of people bouldering at the
Alcove of <a href='directions.html#hp'>Hammond Pond</a>, [finish.  --
rgr, 18-Sep-04.]

<p>The C Wall at the Quincy Quarries is a magnet on sunny winter days,
as it is sheltered from the wind on three sides and gets extra sunlight
reflected off the pond below the slab, which makes it the warmest
outdoor climbing location around, sometime 20 degrees above the
surrounding air temperature.

<p>The <a href="http://www.mit.edu/activities/mitoc/">The MIT Outing
Club (MITOC)</a> is another good resource, especially for students.
They have irregularly-scheduled rock gym trips, and I hear they will
even let Harvard people join.
