<h1>Boston Rocks Web Review</h1>

<p>Welcome to the Boston Rocks Web Review.  <b>Boston Rocks</b> is the
local guidebook for rock climbing locations in the Greater Boston area
and Eastern Massachusetts generally, and is published by the <a
href="http://www.mit.edu/activities/mitoc/">MIT Outing Club</a>.</p>

<p>The first edition is now more than ten years old, so a completely new
edition is being readied for press.  This site contains text and route
descriptions from the new edition, reformatted for Web readability and
ease of navigation.  We are soliciting comments on these crags in order
to make this the best local guidebook we possibly can.  (To submit a
comment, you must first register, but registration is not required for
browsing.)

<p>Both the new <b>Boston Rocks</b> guidebook and this Web site are
all-volunteer projects.</p>

<h2>About Boston Rocks</h2>

<p>Everyone who's done any cragging in the Greater Boston area in the last
ten years probably has a copy of the first edition, a slim paperback
filled with route descriptions and driving directions (and parking
beta!) for the popular crags a short drive from Boston.  Since most of
the crags are small, the crux can sometimes lie in finding them, and the
first <b>BR</b> was indispensable in allowing people to "flash" the
approach.

<p>But the book has become pretty dated over the last ten years.  New
crags have been discovered or developed, old ones that were omitted from
the first edition have grown in popularity, and, in a few cases, old
routes have fallen down.  The biggest change is due to last winter's
filling-in of the Granite Railroad Quarry pool at Quincy Quarries, which
has made a tremendous amount of old rock accessible as never before.  As
a result, there is a crying need for a new edition to encompass all of
these changes.

<p>The following sections describe the <b>Boston Rocks</b> book
publishing project and this Web site.  [Except we need more on the book
project.  -- rgr, 12-Aug-02.]</p>

<a name="Posting+Policy">
<h3>Posting Policy</h3>

<p>By posting comments on this Web site, you are joining an interactive
community.  As such, you have certain rights, chiefly that of <a
href="#Privacy+Policy">privacy</a>, and a few responsibilities:
<ol>
  <li> Be relevant; don't post off-topic comments.
  <li> Be courteous to other users of the site; don't flame or stoop to
       name-calling.
  <li> Be publishable; don't post copyrighted stuff.
</ol>
Comments that do not meet these guidelines will be erased.

<p>By posting comments on this Web site, you agree to allow us to use
your comments, with or without attribution, in any way we see fit, in
order to further the goals of this Web site.  All submissions become the
property of the <b>Boston Rocks</b> authors.

<p>The main goal of this site is to make the new edition of <b>Boston
Rocks</b> the best guidebook possible, so we have to be able to use your
words without quoting you or obtaining explicit permission.  From this
it follows that you cannot post materials that are copyrighted, by you
or by anyone else.  Quoting short excerpts from other guidebooks may be
OK under the principle of fair use (although "fair use" seems to be
under fire from the entertainment industry these days).  You can,
however, feel free to cite such materials or link to them.</p>

<a name="Site+Security">
<h3>Site Security</h3>

<p>The two potential computer security problems that are relevant to
users of this site are called "password sniffing" and "cross-site
scripting."  The first is a real possibility, but with limited potential
for damage; the second is more theoretical, but could involve real
damage to your system.

<p><b>Password Sniffing</b>

<p>Because this site uses <tt>"HTTP:"</tt> and not <tt>"HTTPS:"</tt>
URLs, <b>all information, including user email addresses and passwords,
is transmitted without encryption, and could be intercepted</b> by
anyone in the right position (such as your neighbor and fellow broadband
subscriber) if they have the right tools.  This kind of attack is called
<b>"password sniffing"</b>, and is the reason why you should insist on
using <tt>"HTTPS:"</tt> URLs when you visit your bank or brokerage Web
site.

<p>The Boston Rocks site is designed to minimize the risk of password
sniffing:
<ol>
  <li> Password authentication is only done when necessary, i.e. when
       you are ready to make a comment or want to change your user data.
  <li> Once you have supplied a password, your browser is given an
       "authentication cookie" so that the password doesn't need to be
       retransmitted with every request.
  <li> The cookie expires when you explicitly log out (by clicking on
       the <i>"[Logout&nbsp;now]"</i> link), or after four hours have
       passed since login, whichever happens first.  This limits the
       time window during which a stolen cookie would be useful.
  <li> When you exit your browser, it forgets the cookie, so you will
       need to log in again the next time you visit the site.  (The
       server won't know you exited, so it would still honor the old
       cookie until it expired, unless you logged out first.)
</ol>
Despite this, compromise is still possible; somebody could steal your
password and post rude comments in your name, if they were sufficiently
motivated to do so.  Fortunately, that's all they can do; stealing an
account on this site doesn't do much for the thief, since there is no
credit card information or other sensitive personal data to be stolen.
We are fairly confident that malicious hackers with the necessary tools
and the skills to use them have better things to do with their time than
crack Boston Rocks accounts.

<p>Why not use encryption technology to make password sniffing
impossible?  Note that items 3 and 4 above also help prevent misuse by
somebody who "borrows" your browser while not looking.  This is a
problem that <tt>"HTTPS:"</tt> encryption does not solve, so we would
want to use these short-lived cookies in any case.  Given that, and
given the minor benefit of password sniffing, we feel that encryption
doesn't add enough to make it worth the hassle, in our view.

<p><b>Cross-Site Scripting</b>

<p>Another security risk of community Web sites is something called
"cross-site scripting," where a malicious user posts an HTML comment
that runs a script in other users' browsers.  Such scripts are often
written to take advantage of browser bugs that allow them to sidestep
normal scripting controls, thereby doing arbitrary amounts of damage to
your local computer system.  There are probably more of these browser
bugs than you may realize.  For example, as of 6 August 2002, there were
22 unpatched vulnerabilities in Microsoft Internet Explorer, largely
because Microsoft has a well-known tendency to brush off security
issues; see the <a href="http://www.pivx.com/larholm/unpatched/">
<tt>http://www.pivx.com/larholm/unpatched/</tt></a> page for current
details.  But other browsers are not immune; generally speaking,
browsers and the plugins and system libraries upon which they must rely
have gotten to be too complicated to be trustworthy, especially when
scripting is enabled.

<p>Barring bugs, <b>this site is not vulnerable to cross-site scripting
by design</b>, because it does not allow users to post any kind of HTML.
<b>You are encouraged to disable all scripting in your browser</b>; the
Boston Rocks Web Review site does not use browser scripts of any kind,
and doing so will eliminate any risk of being exposed to cross-site
scripting due to undetected server bugs.</p>

<h3>Privacy Policy</h3>

<p>In order to participate, you must give us your name and email
address.  For our part, we promise not to misuse this data:

<ul>
  <li> Your personal data will not be sold or given to any other
       organization.
  <li> By default, when you contribute, other users of the site will
       only be able to see your user name, and not your email.
       Logged-in users will still be able to send you simple emails from
       the site without learning your address; you can disable this by
       visiting your "user home page."  (And the "email to user"
       functionality hasn't even been implemented yet.)
  <li> [There ought to be a "notify me of followups to my posts" option
       on the user home page.  When and if we implement this, it will be
       turned off by default for users who have already signed up.  --
       rgr, 12-Aug-02.]
  <li> If you choose to make your email address visible, it will only be
       seen by other logged-in users.  This should effectively prevent
       the harvesting of email addresses by spammers.
  <li> You will get no email from us, except when
       <ol>
	 <li> you contact us first;
	 <li> we have a need to contact you in connection with your use
	      of the Boston Rocks Web Review site (i.e. clearing up
	      potential policy violations, notification of a problem
	      with your account, etc.); or
	 <li> one of the editors needs to ask you to clarify one of your
	      postings.
       </ol>
       This is why we want to have a working email address, even though
       we expect any such emails will be very rare.
</ul>

<p>You can change your personal data by visiting your "user home page."
To do this, first log in, then click on your name at the top of the
page.  [Note:  Not much of this interface has actually been implemented
yet.  If you need to change something but don't see how to do it,
contact <a href="mailto:webmaster@bostonrocks.dnsalias.org">the
Webmaster</a> for assistance.  -- rgr, 1-Sep-02.]</p>
