<h1>Climbing resources for the Boston area:  Mailing lists</h1>

resources</a> : Mailing lists

<p>Local and regional mailing lists:

<p>
<a name = climbing>
<dl>
  <dt> <b><tt>climbing@rgrjr.dyndns.org</tt></b>
  <dd> I started managing this list in 2001 for discussion and
       announcements for Boston area climbers; it is still quite low
       volume.  For one thing, I use it to post late-breaking changes to
       the <a href="tuesday-night.html">Tuesday Night North Shore
       climbing schedule</a>.  To subscribe, send mail to <a
       href="mailto:climbing-subscribe@rgrjr.dyndns.org">
       <tt>climbing-subscribe@rgrjr.dyndns.org</tt></a>; neither the
       subject nor the content is important.

       <p>To post a message, send mail to
       <tt>climbing@rgrjr.dyndns.org</tt>.  To reduce spam, there are
       three requirements for messages posted to this list:
       <ol>
	 <li> The message must be directly addressed to the list,
	      i.e. no blind carbon copies (BCC's).
	 <li> The message must be formatted as "plain text" (as opposed
	      to HTML).  Add <tt>climbing@rgrjr.dyndns.org</tt> to your
	      address book, then select "Plain text" as the preferred
	      mail format value.  (In <a
	      href="http://www.mozilla.org/">Mozilla</a>, this is the
	      item labelled "Prefers to recieve mail messages formatted
	      as:" when you edit an address book entry.)
	 <li> The message must not contain attachments.
       </ol>

       <p>You do not need to be a subscriber in order to post.

       <p>[This list has been experiencing technical difficulties
       lately; please stay tuned.  -- rgr, 5-Sep-04.]

  <dt> <b>The White Mountain Report</b>
  <dd> Every Thursday, Al Hospers broadcasts this summary of White
       Mountain climbing conditions, news, and weather, frequently
       including goodies such as a discount coupon from <a
       href="http://ime-usa.com/"> International Mountain Equipment</a>
       in North Conway.  From the report itself:
       <blockquote>
