<p>Local and regional mailing lists:

<p>
<dl>
  <a name = climbing>
  <dt> <b><tt>climbing <i>at</i> rgrjr.dyndns.org</tt> (Boston area
       climber's list)</b>
  <dd> I started managing this list in 2001 for general use; it is still
       quite low volume.  I will post late-breaking changes to the <a
       href="tuesday-night.html">Tuesday Night North Shore climbing
       schedule</a> to this list, for one thing.  To subscribe, send
       mail to <a href="mailto:climbing-subscribe@rgrjr.dyndns.org">
       <tt>climbing-subscribe@rgrjr.dyndns.org</tt></a>; neither the
       subject nor the content is important.  To post a message, send
       mail to <tt>climbing <i>at</i> rgrjr.dyndns.org</tt> (address
       reformatted to avoid spam; replace <tt>"<i>at</i>"</tt> with
       <tt>"@"</tt> before mailing).

       <p>
  <dt> <b>The White Mountain Report</b>
  <dd> Every Thursday, Al Hospers broadcasts this summary of White
       Mountain climbing conditions, news, and weather, frequently
       including a discount coupon from <a href="http://ime-usa.com/">
