<p>Miss Noye and the Room 6 First Grade Class
<br>Room 6
<br>Thompson School
<br>N. Union St.
<br>Arlington, Massachusetts, 02474

<p>Dear Miss Noye and Students,

<p>Thank you very much for all of your wonderful illustrated thank-you
notes; I had great fun reading through each and every one of them.  I am
very glad you all enjoyed my talk on peregrine falcon chick banding.  I
enjoyed telling you about it, partly because it gave me a chance to
remember that day on the rock ledge, and partly because it's always a
pleasure to talk to such an audience of good listeners.

<p>Part of the reason I know that you were good listeners is because you
asked such good questions.  Some of the questions even reminded me of
things I knew I wanted to say, but had forgotten about at the time.
It's easy to forget things the first time you give a talk, so I'm glad
you guys rescued me!

<p>Some of you asked questions in your thank-you notes, and since asking
questions is a really good thing, I'd like to try to answer them:

<ul>
  <li> Justin put some of the bird bones in his picture of the nest
       ledge, and asked what kind of birds they had belonged to.  I
       don't know myself, and even the two bird experts on our trip
       couldn't say at the time.  They did tell me that they were going
       to take the bones to a lab for identification, so I think they
       need to take accurate measurements and compare them to other bird
       bones before they can be sure.  But the bird experts did identify
       some of the feathers found on the ledge.  Some red feathers were
       probably from a cardinal or vireo (I think he said), and a few
       blue ones must have been from a blue jay.

       <p>
  <li> Edie asked, "How long did you cut the rope?"  (Anna asked almost
       the same thing.)  The rope I showed you was cut by accident, so I
       didn't actually measure where it got cut.  It used to be 165 feet
       long, but a sharp rock sawed part way through it when I used it
       once, and so I had to finish cutting through it.  Climbers often
       do this to be sure that they don't use a damaged rope by mistake,
       thinking it is still good.  When we visited the nest ledge that
       day, we actually used a different rope, one that was 200 feet
       long.  This is the length of the ropes they sell at the climbing
       stores, so we didn't actually have to cut it ourselves.

       <p>
  <li> Kaylin asked, "What did the mother bird do to you?"  Nothing,
       fortunately, though she kept swooping at us and screeching,
       hoping to scare us off.  I was laying down under the tree, with
       one leg sticking off the ledge slightly, so I wasn't too worried
       that she could hurt me, even though the tree was a small one.
       But one time she swooped so close to us that I could feel the
       whoosh of the air from her wings, even through my pants leg!
       (Thanks for asking; that's another interesting thing I forgot to
       mention.)  I think she could have scratched up my leg with her
       talons if she had wanted to, but I guess that's not how
       peregrines think.  If I was smaller, maybe raccoon-sized, I bet
       she would have tried something like that, to get us to leave her
       babies alone.  But we were a lot bigger than she was, so she
       wisely decided not to attack.

       <p>
  <li> Bushra, Anurag, and Moto didn't have questions, but all said they
       liked the pictures.  This reminds me that they are on the World
       Wide Web at <a href="http://www.neclimbs.com/wmr_pix/20020530">
       <tt>http://www.neclimbs.com/wmr_pix/20020530</tt></a>, along with
       some others.  The Web site is about climbing in New England, and
       is run by Al, the other climber in our peregrine expedition.  He
       says it's OK if you want to print copies for yourselves.  (I took
       some of these pictures, but he owns the camera, so they are his
       pictures.)

       <p>
  <li> Anthony asks, "Did you have fun two weeks ago?"  You bet I did!
</ul>

<p>And thanks to everybody for all of <i>your</i> cool peregrine
pictures!
