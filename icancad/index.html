<h3>What is "ICanCAD"?</h3>

ICanCAD is a CAD editor for analog and mixed-signal (analog and digital
signals on the same chip) circuit design that is distributed under the
terms of the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html">GNU General
Public License (GPL)</a>.  Version 0.2.0 (April 2002) has fairly
complete schematic editing functionality (think of a "draw" program with
wires), but no support as of yet for netlisting or EDIF I/O.

<a name = can-i-use>
<h3>Can I use ICanCAD now?  What do I need?</h3>

<p>The short answer is "Yes," but it comes with some fairly major
caveats:
<ul>
  <li> ICanCAD is prototype software; it has had only a few hours of
       testing by actual design engineers.  It <i>will</i> break
       (though, like most Lisp applications, you probably won't lose
       much data, if any, when it does).
  <li> Owing to copyright uncertainty, ICanCAD does not come with any
       prebuilt primitive libraries (i.e. you have to draw your own
       transistors and such).
  <li> Only two file formats are supported, both of them completely
       obscure.  EDIF output code is included, but it is only half
       implemented -- and I haven't worked on it for a while, so the
       half that is written probably has some bit rot.  Consequently,
       you will need to do some Lisp programming in order to get more
       than just PostScript out of it.  <br><b>BUT:</b>
  <li> Development has been focused on <a
       href="http://www.franz.com/">Allegro Common Lisp</a> using <a
       href="http://ww.telent.net/cliki/CLIM">CLIM</a> as the GUI
       toolkit, largely for historical reasons.  Unfortunately, there
       does not yet exist a free CLIM that supports a large enough
       subset for ICanCAD (though <a
       href="http://www.mikemac.com/mikemac/McCLIM/">McCLIM</a> seems to
       be getting close).  ICanCAD executables for Windows and Linux are
       available, but if you want to play with the source code, you will
       need to either acquire an Allegro development system, attempt to
       port to LispWorks CLIM, or (shudder) to another GUI toolkit.
</ul>

<p>If that is not enough to scare you off, you can download the current
version, including the latest source and documentation files, from the
<a href="install.html"> Installation instructions</a> page, which also
has more to say about required software.

<h3>What is ICanCAD's future?</h3>

That's a good question.  The original development strategy was focused
narrowly on using ICanCAD as an additional design editing station for a
particular legacy CAD system, at least in its initial deployment.  It
was intended that ICanCAD would subsequently evolve to provide
stand-alone schematic entry and simulation of custom IC's, with
export/import interfaces to other tools, but there is no longer a
timetable for this.

<p>The original short-term goal has been largely met, but at some cost;
the resulting system requires unfree components (namely CLIM), and lacks
features (namely simulation interfaces, and any means of design
import/export) that would make it useful to anyone else.  As of 1 April
2002, the constraints that made this strategy desirable have
disappeared, but so has the funding.

<p>As a result, ICanCAD now sits at a crossroads.  The logical next
thing to do would be to port it to a free GUI toolkit so that people
could pick it up at no cost.  This seems like the minimum requirement to
make it self-sustaining as an Open Source project, but it's unclear when
or how such a port will happen.  (I've been looking at two possible Lisp
Open Source GUI toolkits, <a
href="http://sourceforge.org/projects/clg/"><tt>clg</tt></a> and <a
href="http://www.mikemac.com/mikemac/McCLIM/"><tt>McCLIM</tt></a>, but
it would be a big job even if either was "ready for prime time," as the
saying goes.)

<h3>Does ICanCAD have a mailing list?</h3>

If you are interested in receiving ICanCAD progress reports and such,
send an empty email to <tt>"icancad-subscribe <i>at</i>
rgrjr.dyndns.org"</tt>; you will get a confirmation message by return
mail, to which you must reply.  (This proves you have control of the
email address, lest someone try to subscribe you without your
permission.)  Use <tt>"icancad-unsubscribe <i>at</i>
rgrjr.dyndns.org"</tt> to unsubscribe, and <tt>"icancad <i>at</i>
rgrjr.dyndns.org"</tt> to post queries, comments, and/or bug reports to
the list.  Mailing to <tt>"icancad-help <i>at</i> rgrjr.dyndns.org"</tt>
will remind you of this, and also tell you how to request copies of old
postings.  The <tt>icancad</tt> list is unmoderated, and the volume is
currently, ah, low.

<a name = doc-links>
<h3>Where is ICanCAD documented?</h3>

There is now an <a href="user.html"><b>ICanCAD User's Guide</b></a> page
that links to all available user documentation pages.  Since ICanCAD is
still "alpha-grade" software, it still needs lots of fleshing out; users
unfamiliar with the way my mind works will probably need to read the
code.

<p>See also the <a href="internals.html"> <b>Internal
Documentation</b></a> page, which serves as something of an introduction
to the way my mind works.

<p>ICanCAD now has a <a href="http://ww.telent.net/cliki/ICanCAD">CLiki
page</a> devoted to it.
