<h3>Changes in version 0.2.2</h3>

Released 28-Jan-03.

<ul>
  <li> <b>Initial extraction implementation.</b> This is not yet
       incomplete; there is no user interface per se.  Bus support
       should be complete, but is not well tested.  Error recovery is
       poor.
  <li> <b>Hierarchical SPICE netlisting support.</b> Also incomplete,
       but at least there is a <a
       href='commands.html#com-write-spice-netlist'>"Write Spice
       Netlist"</a> command.  Only MOS devices are supported at present.
  <li> There is also a SPICE netlist reader and simple by-name circuit
       comparator, both undocumented, but they are only just good enough
       to prove to me that the circuit I extracted from some schematic
       today is the same as the one I extracted from that schematic
       yesterday.
  <li> Multiple edit properties (i.e. for a set of selected parts).
  <li> New <a href='commands.html#com-insert-net-label'>"Insert Net
       Label"</a> and <a
       href='commands.html#com-select-connected'>"Select Connected"</a>
       commands.
  <li> EDIF output no longer bombs on dots and links (but still doesn't
       generate correct output).
</ul>

<h3>Changes in version 0.2.1</h3>

Released 6-May-02.

<ul>
  <li> <b>Hardcopy support</b>, albeit rudimentary, has been added.
       This consists of drawing one or more defs to a PostScript file.
       See the <a href="commands.html#com-print-def"> "Print Def"</a>
       command for details.
  <li> <b>ICanCAD now has a <tt>generic-process</tt> technology.</b>
       It's pretty stubby, with only one type of PMOS and NMOS device
       each, but at least that's a start.  And it's in the public
       domain, so it can be shipped as part of ICanCAD, and people can
       hack on it to their heart's content. 
  <li> There is also a new set of public-domain port icons.
  <li> <b>New <a href="commands.html#com-def-operations"> "Def
       Operations"</a> command</b> that allows a set of defs to be
       saved, reverted, printed, etc., all at the same time.  (This is
       similar to the Janus "Kill or Save Defs" command.)
  <li> <b>New <a href="commands.html#com-update-uses"> "Update Uses"</a>
       command</b> for updating use labels and bristles after editing
       the icon.
  <li> Def parameters are now saved and restored properly (fixes <a
       href="bugs.html#bug-47">bug 47</a>).
  <li> Fixed a bug in highlighting kill ring entries.
  <li> Schematic use labels and symbolic uses can now be saved and
       restored (oops).
  <li> Tweaked bristle drawing to make bus-width icons look better.
  <li> The <a href="commands.html#mouse-recenter">
       <tt>mouse-recenter</tt></a> pointer documentation now echoes the
       first point.
  <li> Grids are now defaulted from the technology.
  <li> Several minor fixes to allow ICanCAD to be compiled in CMU Common
       Lisp (still without graphics).
  <li> Several documentation updates (albeit mostly small ones).
</ul>

<h3>Changes in version 0.2.0</h3>

Released 8-Apr-02 (which happens to be my birthday -- ;-).

<ul>
  <li> If the def is empty, <a href="commands.html#com-fit">"Fit"</a>
       now chooses a more appropriate initial scale factor.
  <li> When starting up, ICanCAD will no longer look for any random def
       (e.g. a port icon), but will create a new def in the
       <tt>"<i>user</i>:work;"</tt> library instead.
  <li> Fixed a nasty bug that blew up when caching presentation objects
       near the mouse.  The code grew the array, but not the variable
       that held the limit.
  <li> The last part-kind added is now remembered separately for each
       view.  This avoids (for instance) offering to add wires to an
       icon.
  <li> Fixed a use label redisplay bug.
  <li> Fixed another use redisplay bug when recomputing the use bbox.
  <li> <a href="commands.html#com-set-technology">"Set Technology"</a>
       now offers a choice of unloaded technologies, and ensures that
       the one chosen is loaded.
  <li> Compiles on CMU Common Lisp (again).
  <li> Numerous other code and documentation tweaks.
</ul>

<h3>Changes in version 0.1.23</h3>

Released 28-Mar-02.

<ul>
  <li> <b>Engineering expressions are now fully supported.</b>  Also,
       an "Eval" command has been added to take advantage of this.
  <li> Right-angle bends in wires are now filleted with circular arcs.
  <li> The "Add Wire" command now has a "Flip direction" button.
  <li> Use parameters are now edited using the presentation type
       specified in the def parameter descriptors.  However, this
       presentation type is now always <tt>engineering-number</tt>,
       since def parameters should always be allowed to be expressions,
       regardless of what one might want to do to limit the result of
       evaluating that expression.
  <li> Fixed a nasty bug in case-insensitivity of engineering suffixes
       that might have turned a Janus "milli" into an ICanCAD "mega."
  <li> The <a href="commands.html"> <tt>commands.html</tt></a> page can
       now be generated completely automatically.
  <li> Plus the usual random bug fixes and other changes.
</ul>

<h3>Changes in version 0.1.22</h3>

Released 22-Mar-2002.  (Source tarball re-released after a previous
release on 19-Mar-2002.)

<ul>
  <li> <b>Connection points are now much better supported by the user
       interface.</b> In particular, connection to existing off-grid
       locations (i.e. off-grid bristles and the wires that connect to
       them) now works reasonably well.  This includes some internal
       caching that greatly speeds up mouse tracking.
  <li> <b>Mouse gesture bindings were revised extensively</b> in order
       to compensate for a lack of usable modifier keys in Windows; see
       the <a href="general.html#invoking-mouse-commands">Invoking mouse
       commands in editor windows</a> section for more information.
  <li> New "Select Loaded" command.
  <li> "Kill Def" is now more accurately called "Unload Def."
  <li> "Add Use" now has better error handling, "Add Loaded Def" now
       only offers to add uses of defs with icons.
  <li> "Add Text" now accepts a sequence of strings on the command
       line.
  <li> Text parts now highlight as text when adding or moving (in small
       numbers).
  <li> Can now do <tt>setf</tt> of <tt>&gt;&gt;</tt> forms.
  <li> Engineering notation is now always used for numbers.
  <li> The <tt>visible?</tt> property of pins can now be saved in Janus
       format (even though Janus doesn't support it).
  <li> Experimental (i.e. buggy and incomplete) support for def name
       completion has been added.
  <li> Work around <tt>clim:menu-choose</tt> bug in part and point
       command pop-up menus.
  <li> The <a href="commands.html">command documentation page</a> has
       been regenerated with the latest inline command descriptions.
  <li> The code for generating HTML documentation is now included.
  <li> Plus other documentation improvements.
  <li> Plus numerous internal tweaks.
</ul>

<h3>Changes in version 0.1.21</h3>

<p>This was never actually released.

<ul>
  <li> <b>Pin and net label "Edit Properties" are much improved.</b> In
       particular, ICanCAD now supports the usual Janus repertoire of
       <tt>:context</tt> and <tt>:special-property</tt> values.
  <li> <b>"Edit Parameters" command for adding/changing def
       parameters.</b>
  <li> <b>Icons of existing uses can now be changed in "Edit
       Properties."</b>
  <li> New "Return To Schematic" command (for after "Edit Icon"), new
       "Insert Def" command.
  <li> New icon "Add Schematic Labels" and "Add Schematic Ports"
       commands, to speed up icon creation when the schematic already
       exists.
  <li> The "Edit Def Properties" command has been renamed to "Def
       Properties" (where it isn't shadowed by "Edit Def").
  <li> "Add Pin" and "Add Net Label" now allow more than one of each to
       be added with a single command -- use semicolons to separate the
       values.
  <li> It is now possible to back up when adding wires.
  <li> Library directories are now created when needed, after asking the
       user (better supported in order to fix bugs).
  <li> Undo/Redo support for unbound properties.
  <li> Many improvements/bug fixes to the Janus conversion code,
       including support for parameters and net label properties.
  <li> Technology-specific stuff now lives in the
       <tt>"icancad:process;**;"</tt> tree, instead of
       <tt>"icancad:code;"</tt>.
  <li> When typing a def name, the merged result is now shown after you
       hit <tt>Enter</tt> or the space bar.
  <li> Pointer highlighting is now correctly redrawn after click
       (bug&nbsp;25).
  <li> Renaming a def now updates the frame label.
  <li> Includes patch for ACL 6.1/Windows font bug.
  <li> Plus numerous internal tweaks.
</ul>

<h3>Changes in version 0.1.20</h3>

Released 21-Feb-2002.

<p>This has lots of new stuff, and probably more than a few broken
things as well.  The massive <tt>wiring.lisp</tt> and
<tt>janus-save.lisp</tt> patches have been integrated and (to some
extent) tested.  These new features will be the basis for the 0.2.0
release, for which this one is really something of an alpha prerelease
(with at least one more such expected).

<ul>
  <li> <b>Schematic wiring is now fully supported.</b>
  <li> <b>Two new Lisp packages have been added.</b> These are called
       <tt>ICANCAD-USER</tt> and <tt>ICANCAD-ATLAS</tt>, and are needed
       for Janus compatibility (among other things).
  <li> <b>Limited technology (IC process) support has been added</b>,
       including a "Set Technology" command.  Technologies are
       autoloaded when they are first needed.  No technology definitions
       ship with ICanCAD as of yet.
  <li> <b>Transparent interoperability with Janus is now supported.</b>
       Defs can now be written back to disk in Janus format (which is
       now fully supported, except for archaicisms).  This happens
       automatically when you read and write defs with <tt>.sch</tt> and
       <tt>.shape-def</tt> view suffixes.
  <li> New "Add Device", "Add Loaded", and "Add Recent" commands, which
       are all variations on "Add Use."  Also, a new "Add" menu-bar menu
       was created.  [The documentation still needs to be updated to
       include these, though.  -- rgr, 21-Feb-02.]
  <li> The new <tt>com-load-pbin</tt> and <tt>com-dump-pbin</tt>
       commands can be used to help diagnose and fix save format
       problems (assuming the PBIN format encoding is intact).
  <li> The "guts" of a use are now displayed when
       adding/moving/stretching if there are at most five of them.  This
       is controlled by the <tt>*maximum-uses-to-highlight-innards*</tt>
       variable.
  <li> When adding a use with multiple icons, <tt>Super-Right</tt> now
       allows the user pick a new one.
  <li> Schematic uses now have unique (within the def) names generated
       for them when added to a def.
  <li> Aborting a command now backs out any partial effects of the
       command (bug fix).
  <li> Fixed some bugs with generating mouse documentation.
  <li> Newly created schematic uses now get their child def parameters
       set to the defaults (bug fix).
  <li> When converting from Janus format, coordinates are now divided by
       10 (instead of 20) to reduce roundoff problems.
  <li> Extensive documentation updates.
</ul>

<h3>Changes in version 0.1.19</h3>

Released 25-Jan-2002.

<p>This is another release of mostly minor fixes and internal changes.

<ul>
  <li> Report roundoff errors in Janus conversion.  If
       <tt>*janus-conversion-verbose?*</tt> is set, then a message is
       generated for every roundoff error.
  <li> The "Cut" and "Copy" commands now print a message if no parts
       were copied to the kill ring.
  <li> The two-point rewindow command now offers "Exit" as an option
       when asking for the second point.
  <li> Part colors are now canonicalized when saving, which makes the
       resulting files more compact.
  <li> Plus numerous internal tweaks.
</ul>

<h3>Changes in version 0.1.18</h3>

Released 7-Jan-2002.

<p>For the most part, these are minor fixes or internal changes, since
"serious" development is now happening in patch files, but it's been too
long since the last release.

<ul>
  <li> Atlas text parts in Janus icons are now converted; previously,
       they were ignored.
  <li> Labels in Janus icons that do not correspond to def parameters
       are ignored, and a warning is printed.
  <li> If you write a new version of a def on disk (still not
       recommended, as the save format hasn't stabilized yet), the old
       disk file is correctly made into a backup file.
  <li> At startup, load "sys:icancad.lisp" instead of "sys:clinit.cl".
  <li> Slightly better window labels (at least internally).
  <li> Lots of other minor internal tweaks.
</ul>

<h3>Changes in version 0.1.17</h3>

Released 15-Dec-2001.

<ul>
  <li> <b>ICanCAD now uses PBIN format for saved defs.</b>
  <li> Init file loading has been improved, and made more consistent
       between the binary and source distributions.
  <li> "Edit Def" and related commands are now more robust in the face
       of defs that are so broken they cannot be displayed.
  <li> Some bugs in parsing and handling wildcarded def names have been
       fixed.  It is not likely that all such bugs have been fixed (and
       the change is large enough that it may create problems of its
       own).
  <li> Fixed bugs in reading PBIN strings, dotted lists.
  <li> Fixed a bug in converting schematic net labels.
  <li> The top level now avoid infinite error loops when (e.g.)
       something cannot be displayed; if three errors happen after a
       single command, ICanCAD stops with a "Three strikes and you're
       out" message.
  <li> Skip and retry options are now presented (in the debugger) when a
       child def cannot be found during conversion of a Janus use.
</ul>

<h3>Changes in version 0.1.16</h3>

Released 6-Dec-2001.

<ul>
  <li> <b>The "List Defs" command now lists defs on disk, instead of
       just those in memory</b>, and offers to truncate long listings by
       just listing the libraries (aka directories) with defs in them.
       The old "List Defs" command is now the "List Loaded Defs"
       command.  <b>Both commands now accept <tt>"**"</tt>, the
       directory "accordion wildcard" sequence.</b>
  <li> "Rename Def" and "Write Def" (aka "Save As") now check to see if
       the directory exists, and offers to create it if not.
  <li> Since scroll bars didn't work and the implementation was too
       obscure to figure out how to fix them, scroll bars have been
       removed from editor windows entirely.  (Re-adding them is now on
       the list of enhancements; see <a
       href="bugs.html#enh-4">enhancement 4</a>.)
  <li> Fixed two bugs in computing the available modifier chords for the
       "More commands on..." pointer documentation.
  <li> Fixed a bug that drew net label icons upside-down for some label
       orientations.
  <li> ICanCAD now comes with an updated version of mk-defsystem 3.2i
       from <a href="http://clocc.sourceforge.net/">CLOCC</a> (labelled
       "defsystem-3-2i-2" in order to distinguish it from the previous
       version, which was also "3.2i").  I have modified it slightly to
       pass logical pathnames to the <tt>compile-file</tt> function
       (patch submitted).
  <li> Other miscellaneous release-related cleanups.
</ul>

<h3>Changes in version 0.1.15</h3>

Released 27-Nov-2001.

<ul>
  <li> <b>ICanCAD now understands Janus "PBIN" (Portable Binary)
       format.</b>  This is the default save format in Janus, so all
       Janus design databases can be converted directly.  ICanCAD still
       doesn't understand how to write PBIN, nor how to convert back to
       the Janus save format, so it is still not possible to edit Janus
       designs.
  <li> <b>Many new commands:</b>
       <ul>
	 <li> "Add Arc"
	 <li> "Add Label" (for icon label-def parts)
	 <li> "Add Use" (stubby, and hasn't really been tested for
	      schematic uses)
	 <li> "New Def"
	 <li> "Stretch Orthogonally" (menu command that toggles.  "Set
	      Def Modified" now toggles in the same way.)
	 <li> "Delete vertex" (mouse command)
       </ul>
  <li> "List Defs" now takes a wildcard def name argument.
  <li> The menu of kinds of parts to add (available on Super-Right) now
       has a nearly complete set of current and future parts.  Part
       kinds that are not legal for the current def, such as label-defs
       in anything but a schematic icon def, or that are not yet
       implemented, are greyed out in this menu.
  <li> Similarly, the "Add <i>Kind</i>" menu items on the menu bar
       'Edit' menu are now greyed out if the part <i>kind</i> isn't
       legal to add to the def being edited.
  <li> <b>Finally fixed text drawing.</b> Text is now drawn to fit
       within the bounding box, to the limits of the font set available
       through CLIM.
  <li> <b>Fixed several mouse tracking bugs:</b>
       <ul>
	 <li> Mouse motion events are no longer dropped.  This was due
	      to IPC bugs between the ICanCAD process and the Motif
	      event handler (I had forgotten that they ran in separate
	      threads).  More such bugs may yet exist.
	 <li> Windows now keep track of when the mouse has exited.
	 <li> ALL shift changes are now handled properly.  The
	      highlighting and pointer documentation now update
	      immediately; formerly, you had to also move the mouse.
       </ul>
       Plus related pointer document code robustness improvements.
  <li> Fixed a bug whereby "Add Line" gave you a polygon, and "Add
       Polygon" gave you a line.
  <li> Fixed a bug in selection highlighting that interacted badly with
       stretching, leading to screen garbage.
  <li> Fixed a bug in screen erasure (i.e. more screen garbage).
  <li> Arcs, oblongs, and symbolic uses now save and load correctly.
  <li> Menus and <a href="commands.html">command documentation</a> were
       updated to make them correspond by name.  Some additional command
       documentation was written, but there is still much to be done.
  <li> Many miscellaneous internal cleanups.
</ul>

<h3>Changes in version 0.1.14</h3>

Released 12-Nov-2001.

<ul>
  <li> <b>ICanCAD now has a kill ring</b>, also known as a 'cut buffer.'
       There are still some missing features (see <a
       href="bugs.html">bugs 17 and 18</a>).
  <li> <b>Arcs are now stretchable.</b>  They stretch the same way they
       are added, by dragging any of the three defining vertices.
  <li> In contradistinction to polygons, lines are never filled now,
       though they still have a fill color.  Closing a line (e.g. by
       adding a vertex or moving the endpoints) converts it into a
       polygon, which shares the same part class as lines and differ
       only in being closed.  (Unfortunately, there is no user interface
       as yet to convert a polygon back into a line; see <a
       href="bugs.html">bug 16</a>.)
  <li> Part selection is now shown consistently for all selected parts
       by highlighting their handles.
  <li> Some internal vector-text fixes (but the font is still not
       complete).
  <li> Miscellaneous Genera updates.
</ul>

<h3>Changes in version 0.1.13</h3>

Released 6-Nov-2001.

<ul>
  <li> <b>Parts are now stretchable</b> (but not yet arcs).  Select the
       part, then click on a corner or an edge to drag it to a new
       location.  Some of this behavior can be controlled via the
       <tt>*handle-radius*</tt> and <tt>*stretch-orthogonally-p*</tt>
       variables (q.v.).
  <li> <b>There are now more part-adding commands on the "Edit"
       menu</b>, nearly a complete set.  There is also an "Add last
       part" command on Super-Middle, and an "Add random part" command
       on Super-Right.
  <li> New "Add vertex" mouse command.
  <li> Gesture definitions are now in their own file,
       <tt>clim-gestures.lisp</tt>.  This may make it easier for users
       to redefine them.  (Also added the <tt>handles.lisp</tt> and
       <tt>clim-add.lisp</tt> files.)
  <li> Lines are now highlighted with a dashed pattern, controlled by
       the <tt>*highlighted-line-dash-pattern*</tt> variable.
  <li> Conversion of a Janus shape-def now attempts to guess a
       reasonable default grid, if none was defined explicitly.
  <li> A bug in the interpretation of Janus rotation angles was fixed,
       which also exposed a bug in rotation/reflection composition
       order.
  <li> Some bugs in drawing arrowheads were fixed.  Arrowhead drawing is
       now consistent with polygons in its use of fill and outline
       colors.
  <li> Fixed a bug in generating the command documentation string if it
       was more than the line length.
  <li> Plus lots of miscellaneous changes (make props editable, new
       gestures, new generics, debug tools, obsoleting old mouse code,
       etc.).
</ul>

<h3>Changes in version 0.1.12</h3>

Released 31-Oct-2001.

<ul>
  <li> <b>A second line of pointer documentation is now supported</b>,
       and is used for "More commands on ..." (but the code that
       generates it still doesn't work quite right).
  <li> New <tt>*part*</tt> variable, which is set by selecting a single
       part.
  <li> Improved highlighting of lines/polygons/arrows, controlled by the
       <tt>*highlighted-line-dash-pattern*</tt> variable.
  <li> Improved selection of polygons.
  <li> Redundant line (path or polygon) vertices are now removed when
       the line is created or changed.  (They are also removed for
       arrows, which is probably a bug.)
  <li> Two bugs in arc transformation fixed:  Angles are now transformed
       with the part (previously, they were ignored), and a bug in
       <tt>rot90</tt> arc drawing was fixed (that had probably been
       caused/uncovered by the transform composition fix in 0.1.10).
  <li> "Pop" & "Select region" now insist on having an editor window,
       avoiding blowups.
  <li> Fixed an internal property definition bug:  An explicit
       <tt>:writer</tt> function should override setting the slot for
       properties with <tt>:instance</tt> allocation.
  <li> Some splitting of source and documentation files, plus additional
       documentation update.
</ul>

<h3>Changes in version 0.1.11</h3>

Released 24-Oct-2001.

<p>New <a href="dpt.html">dynamic presentation translator</a> features:
<ul>
  <li> <b>Search of part and point objects underneath the mouse is now
       integrated with finding applicable commands</b> (CLIM
       translators), for both top-level commands and modal subcommands.
  <li> <b>Stateful highlighting</b> allows modal commands to provide
       better feedback.
  <li> Rewindowing commands (internally, all presentation actions) can
       be executed at any time within modal commands.
  <li> It is no longer necessary to move the mouse into the bounding box
       of a part in order to select it and/or operate on it; being
       within <tt>*min-selection-distance*</tt> (default is 20 pixels)
       is enough.
  <li> "Move" and "Copy" now allow rotation and reflection as modal
       subcommands; their effects are reflected in the orientation of
       the parts that are dragged along with the mouse cursor.
  <li> Plus miscellaneous related pointer documentation improvements.
</ul>

<p>Other changes:
<ul>
  <li> "Describe Part" now actually does <tt>describe</tt>.
  <li> Selection of lines and polygons now uses the path itself, and not
       just the bounding box.
</ul>
  
<p>Other internal changes:
<ul>
  <li> Added some hooks for part handles, for stretching parts other
       than schematic wiring.
</ul>

<h3>Changes in version 0.1.10</h3>

Released 11-Oct-2001 (which is a palindrome date if expressed in the
American "MM-DD-YY" style: 10-11-01).

<p>New:
<ul>
  <li> New <tt>make-transform</tt> function that provides an interface
       to transform composition routines.
  <li> New "Zoom" command that takes a relative scale factor.
</ul>

<p>Fixed:
<ul>
  <li> <b>Fixed a major bug in computing transform composition</b>:  If
       x.y was different than y.x, it had been using the wrong
       composition order.  This fixes some drawing problems where the
       bbox would appear in a different place than the use (because the
       use was being drawn with the window.use composition, but the bbox
       was effectively being transformed by each one separately), but
       may expose new Rel-Janus transform conversion bugs.
  <li> Fixed a bug in move of overlapping parts; the second part didn't
       get undrawn properly.  (Only affects the non-presentation
       version.)
  <li> Fixed a bug in text save/copy that prevented the text string
       itself from being copied.
  <li> The history of visited defs (used by "Select Buffer") is now
       initialized correctly.  It used to omit the first def.
  <li> Label use bboxes are now initialized more intelligently.
  <li> Fixed a bug in rehighlighting on re-exposure after being
       partially obscured that would left garbage on the screen.  (May
       only affect the non-presentation version.)
  <li> Use parts now get highlighted correctly (we used to ignore the
       use transform).
  <li> Some text size tweaks.  It's far from perfect; strings still run
       outside the bbox at smaller scales, because the character aspect
       ratio gets fatter as the scale decreases.
</ul>

<h3>Changes in version 0.1.9</h3>

Released 30-Sep-2001.  (Not much happened in the two and a half months
since the last release because I've been working on things that are not
yet ready for release.)

<ul>
  <li> New "Select Buffer" command.
  <li> Grid support, "Changed Def Grid" command.  (Previously, there had
       been a hardwired grid that happened to work for the test
       schematics I've seen.)
  <li> New <tt>*draw-too-big-text*</tt> and
       <tt>*draw-too-small-text*</tt> user option variables.
  <li> <tt>edit-properties-for-value</tt>, plus numerous property
       substrate tweaks.
</ul>

Other changes were made for the sake of the following incomplete
features:
<ul>
  <li> Vector font for last-resort text drawing.
  <li> McCLIM support.
  <li> Genera support.
</ul>
These features are not yet ready for release.

<h3>Changes in version 0.1.8</h3>

Released 19-Jul-2001.

<ul>
  <li> "Add Polygon" always creates filled objects; "Add Line" never
       fills.
  <li> Clicking on the background pane now does "Unselect All" only on
       CAD windows (i.e. not the interaction pane).
  <li> <tt>find-property</tt> now signals the <tt>unbound-property</tt>
       condition if the property is not bound.
  <li> Fixed some bugs in copying a use with labels.
  <li> Made the "Push" and "Push Icon" commands work from the menu.
</ul>

<h3>Changes in version 0.1.7</h3>

Released 28-Jun-2001.

<ul>
  <li> <b>Use labels now behave much as in Rel-Janus.</b> To support
       this, push contexts (the object that tells from where you pushed)
       now record the "actual" parameter values for the use through
       which you are pushed.
  <li> The new <tt>&gt;&gt;</tt> macro is for iterated
       <tt>get-property</tt> references.  For instance, <tt>(&gt;&gt; x1
       part3)</tt> returns the left edge coordinate of the part named
       <tt>part3</tt> in the current def.
  <li> There is now a formal <tt>:default</tt> property attribute.  The
       optional third argument to <tt>get-property</tt> is now obsolete.
  <li> Minor bug fixes:  Revert Def ensures that there is a disk version
       first, before any further questions;
       <tt>default-frame-top-level</tt> now binds the <tt>*package*</tt>
       global, def computed props now return correct <tt>bound-p</tt>
       value, primitive icon parameters are now properly converted.
  <li> Much internal class rearrangement, to support uses with internal
       parts (for use labels, and eventually bristles).
</ul>

<h3>Changes in version 0.1.6</h3>

Released 15-Jun-2001.

<ul>
  <li> New *icancad-version* variable holds the version string,
       e.g. "0.1.6".
  <li> The Pop command now knows from whence you Pushed.
  <li> Internal text part reorganization (split the text-part class out
       of basic-text).
  <li> New label-def part class, now used instead of plain text when
       converting label-text parts in Rel-Janus shape defs.
  <li> New ICC package nickname, clean up of legacy packages via
       aliasing.
</ul>

<h3>Changes in version 0.1.5</h3>

Released 19-May-2001.

<ul>
  <li> "Revert Def" and "Kill Def" commands.
  <li> Fixed two windowing bugs.
  <li> Miscellaneous internal cleanups.
</ul>

<h3>Changes in version 0.1.4</h3>

Released 11-May-2001.

<ul>
  <li> New menus, filled with commands that mostly don't work yet.  But
       ICanCAD is finally beginning to look like an editor.
  <li> "Set Fill Color" and "Set Outline Color" that change the color of
       selected parts, or the default color if none selected.
  <li> "Add Rect" and "Add Line" commands.
  <li> Fixed some display update bugs.
  <li> Added the <a href="window-internals.html">
       window-internals.html</a> page.
</ul>

<h3>Changes in version 0.1.3</h3>

Released 14-Apr-2001.

<ul>
  <li> Now compiles in CMUCL, though without the graphics.  [7-Dec-00]
  <li> Proper <tt>def-name</tt> objects.  [8-Mar-01]
  <li> <tt>def-pathname</tt> now uses the "ICANCAD-DESIGNS" logical host
       to map def names to file names.  [11-Mar-01]
  <li> Fixed a bug that didn't allow def <tt>":writable-p&nbsp;nil"</tt>
       properties to be reread from disk.  [23-Mar-01]
  <li> def-child-uses, def-parent-uses, def-child-defs, and
       def-parent-defs fns.  [24-Mar-01]
  <li> basic part-saving support machinery.  [25-Mar-01]
  <li> <tt>file-state</tt> structures, support for detecting defs
       changed on disk.  [27-Mar-01]
  <li> Hack "lazy refresh" implementation that uses CLIM output
       recording.  [5-Apr-01]
  <li> Started improving property/slot/initarg name consistency.
       [8-Apr-01 &amp; continuing]
  <li> Fix <tt>finish-transaction</tt> bug when Undo is disabled.
       [11-Apr-01]
  <li> Fix bug in undrawing selected part.  [13-Apr-01]
  <li> Clean up def creation, especially for conversion.  [13-Apr-01]
  <li> Don't save :virtual props as explicit.  [14-Apr-01]

       defs accordingly.  [14-Apr-01]
  <li> Pop, Set Modified, Save Def, Write Def (Save As), Rename Def
       commands.  [various dates]
</ul>
