<hr>

<p>This pages includes bugs fixed prior to 8 April 2002 (i.e. in the
0.2.0 release or earlier).

<dl compact>
  <dt> 1.
  <dd> The selection highlighting is all screwed up with respect to
       redrawing.  This is (at least in part) because ICanCAD tries to
       handle the highlighting itself, so it misses redraws that happen
       automatically within CLIM.  [Fixed by changes in releases 0.1.10
       and 0.1.11; ICanCAD now does all redrawing itself.  -- rgr,
       25-Oct-01.]

  <dt> 2.
  <dd> Auto-generation of use names doesn't work yet.  (See also the
       discussion of <a href="part-internals.html#part-names">"Part
       names"</a>.)  [Fixed in version 0.1.20.  -- rgr, 7-Feb-02.]

  <dt> 3.
  <dd> There is no UI for changing def parameters yet.  [fixed in
       version 0.1.21.  -- rgr, 26-Feb-02.]

  <dt> 4.
  <dd> There is a bug in figuring out the bounding box of a freshly
       copied use with use labels.  [This seems to have been fixed.  --
       rgr, 25-Oct-01.]

  <dt> 7.
  <dd> Rotation of arcs is wrong.  This may be an artifact of fixing the
       transform composition bug on 11-Oct-01.  (Apparently so; fixed in
       Release 0.1.12.  -- rgr, 27-Oct-01.)

  <dt> 8.
  <dd> Scroll bars no longer work.  They did not work very well before,
       but Release 0.1.11 broke them entirely.  [punted entirely in
       release 0.1.16; see <a href="bugs.html#enh-4">enhancement 4</a>.
       -- rgr, 28-Nov-01.]

  <dt> 9.
  <dd> Text for text parts is frequently drawn outside of the bounding
       box of the part, leaving garbage on the screen when the part is
       undrawn.  This is because our simple-minded heuristic for
       choosing font sizes doesn't take into account the fact that the
       character aspect ratio changes (smaller characters are
       proportionally fatter).  [Finally fixed in 0.1.15, in a
       reasonably portable way.  -- rgr, 27-Nov-01.]  [Unfortunately,
       the fix broke the Windows version completely.  A patch to fix ACL
       CLIM on Windows was included with the 0.1.22 release.  -- rgr,
       14-Apr-02.]

  <dt> 10.
  <dd> If you quit with modified buffers, and then decline to confirm,
       CLIM barfs with a "No methods applicable for generic function
       POINTER-SHEET with args NIL" message.  [This seems to have to do
       with stale mouse events for deexposed popup dialogs.  I've put in
       a small workaround kludge that seems to address the problem.
       This might be Franz Inc's problem, but it is difficult to
       characterize and the workaround is trivial, so it's not worth
       reporting.  -- rgr, 3-Nov-01.]

  <dt> 13.
  <dd> Arc stretching is not supported.  [Fixed in release 0.1.14.  --
       rgr, 7-Nov-01.]

  <dt> 14.
  <dd> There is no user interface for changing the orthogonal stretching
       flag (implemented internally by the
       <tt>*stretch-orthogonally-p*</tt> variable).  -- rgr, 2-Nov-01.
       [Fixed in release 0.1.15.  -- rgr, 25-Nov-01.]

  <dt> 16.
  <dd> Not to mention a user interface for opening "closed" figures.
       Right now, polygons and closed arrows always stay closed, and
       circles always open into arcs.  -- rgr, 9-Nov-01.  [The "Delete
       Vertex" command in 0.1.15 takes care of the polygon/arrow case.
       -- rgr, 23-Nov-01.]

  <dt> 19.
  <dd> Mouse highlighting is not correctly shut off before updating the
       display, often leaving garbage on the screen.  -- rgr, 11-Nov-01.
       [Fixed by a number of changes in release 0.1.15.  -- rgr,
       25-Nov-01.]

  <dt> 21.
  <dd> Super-Left dead-on to a vertex highlights the vertex, even though
       the pointer documentation shows "Recenter" (and that's what
       happens if you click).  -- rgr, 26-Nov-01.  [Actually, the code
       was behaving correctly as written.  But this was still confusing,
       so I fixed it by changing the presentation type for "Recenter"
       from <tt>T</tt> to <tt>pt</tt>.  -- rgr, 20-Feb-02.]

  <dt> 22.
  <dd> The <tt>fresh-line</tt> after command echo/input is missing.
       [Fixed in release 0.1.16.  -- rgr, 28-Nov-01.]

  <dt> 23.
  <dd> The second mouse documentation line (that starts "More commands
       on ...") usually misses the "Meta-" chord.  [This was because of
       two errors; both are fixed in release 0.1.16.  -- rgr, 2-Dec-01.]

  <dt> 25.
  <dd> Removing selection highlighting (e.g. by invoking the
       <tt>part-to-toggle-select</tt> command on <tt>Shift-Left</tt>")
       fails to redraw pointer highlighting afterwards.  -- rgr,
       2-Dec-01.  [Actually, the problem was more general; any click
       would unhighlight the current presentation, and you'd have to
       move the mouse to something else (or change the shift state)
       before highlighting would resume working normally.  Fixed in
       0.1.21 by reinstating the "did the highlighter change?" test.  --
       rgr, 22-Feb-02.]

  <dt> 26.
  <dd> ICanCAD init file loading needs to be cleaned up.  The debug
       version should load <tt>~/icancad.lisp</tt> before starting, and
       the same code should be used for the delivery version as well.
       -- rgr, 6-Dec-01.  [The init code in the 0.1.17 release is
       improved, and should be more predictable.  -- rgr, 14-Dec-01.]

  <dt> 28.
  <dd> When writing defs, the old disk version is not properly
       superceded.  -- rgr, 19-Dec-01.  [fixed in 0.1.18; the old file
       is now renamed as a backup version.  -- rgr, 29-Dec-01.]

  <dt> 29.
  <dd> Janus conversion should flush label defs that don't correspond to
       schematic parameters.  [fixed in 0.1.18.  -- rgr, 29-Dec-01.]

  <dt> 30.
  <dd> When reading a Janus shape def, text parts do not get converted.
       [fixed in 0.1.18.  -- rgr, 29-Dec-01.]

  <dt> 32.
  <dd> The "Add Use" command needs to support icon selection, especially
       for primitives.  [fixed in 0.1.20, by putting a "Select a new
       icon" command on <tt>Super-Right</tt>.  -- rgr, 20-Feb-02.]

  <dt> 33.
  <dd> Along the same lines, we also need a user interface for changing
       icons of existing uses, again, especially for primitives.  --
       rgr, 20-Feb-02.  [fixed in 0.1.21, though it's pretty kludgy.
       this also allows choosing a new icon via <tt>edit-properties</tt>
       when adding uses initially. -- rgr, 7-Mar-02.]

  <dt> 38.
  <dd> The "Add another part" command (bound to "Control-Middle")
       doesn't check to see whether the last part kind is legal in the
       current def.  -- rgr, 19-Mar-02.  [Fixed in 0.2.0.  -- rgr,
       2-Apr-02.]

  <dt> 42.
  <dd> When copying or adding a use, selecting a point that snaps to a
       bristle to start dragging makes it impossible to put that bristle
       on a wire; when the mouse gets close enough, the wire
       presentation is active (highlighted) instead.  [Bug reported
       24-Mar-02 by Martin Mallinson.  Fixed in 0.1.23.  -- rgr,
       24-Mar-02.]

  <dt> 43.
  <dd> The "Def Properties" command doesn't seem to be available.  [Bug
       reported 24-Mar-02 by Martin Mallinson.  Fixed in 0.1.23.  Also
       added "Def Properties" and "Def Parameters" to the "Edit" menu.
       -- rgr, 24-Mar-02.]

  <dt> 44.
  <dd> Engineering numbers in expressions (e.g. <tt>"(* 1.25u (&gt;&gt;
       scale-factor))"</tt>) must be fully supported.  [Bug reported
       24-Mar-02 by Martin Mallinson.]  [Fixed in 0.1.23, but may be
       flaky.  -- rgr, 26-Mar-02.]
