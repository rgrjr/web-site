<h2>ICanCAD glossary</h2>

Some of these terms are in common use in the CAD industry (and must be
defined here because the CAD industry is infamous for inconsistent
terminology), some are peculiar to ICanCAD (and thereby contribute to
that well-deserved infamy), and a few are Common Lisp terms explained
here for the convenience of users.

<dl>
  <a name = allocation>
  <dt> <b>allocation</b> (property)
  <dd> Similar in concept to CLOS slot allocation, storage for a
       property can be arranged in one of the following ways:
       <ul>
	 <li> Primitive, if stored as a CLOS slot;
	 <li> Explicit, if stored on the  <tt>basic-thing</tt> property
	      list slot; or
	 <li> Virtual, if computed rather than stored.
       </ul>
       By default, a property is primitive if the object has a CLOS slot
       of the same name, and explicit otherwise.  However, note that it
       is possible to shadow this attribute, so the presence of a slot
       does not automatically mean a primitive property.

  <a name = bristle>
  <dt> <b>bristle</b> (n.)
  <dd> A connection point to a schematic <a href="#use">use</a> that
       makes a physical connection to a <a href="#port">port</a> in the
       schematic.  The location is defined by a <a href="#pin">pin</a>
       (q.v.) in the icon.

  <a name = bus>
  <dt> <b>bus</b> (n.)
  <dd> A schematic bus represents a collection of physical wires that
       are treated as a unit; each drawn wire in a schematic can be
       though of as carrying a bus, and may therefore represent more
       than one wire in the layout.  Each bus contains one or more <a
       href="#net">nets</a>, in a specified order, where the number of
       nets is the bus' <a href="#width">width</a>.  The individual nets
       can be subscripted, as in <tt>"wide&lt;5&gt;"</tt>, so the bus
       therefore acts like a one-dimensional array of nets.  Busses can
       be extracted from other busses with <tt>"wide&lt;3:8&gt;"</tt>.
       Busses and bus names are local to the schematic in which they
       appear.  See the <a href="connectivity.html">"ICanCAD Schematic
       Nets and Busses"</a> section for a full treatment.

  <a name = chord>
  <dt> <b>chord</b> (of modifiers, as in "mouse chord")
  <dd> In order to cram as many commands as possible onto a three-button
       mouse without requiring intermediate menus, ICanCAD takes
       advantage of the fact that modifier keys such as <tt>"Ctrl"</tt>
       and <tt>"Shift"</tt> can be held down with the one hand while
       clicking the mouse with the other hand.  The combination of
       modifier keys and button is what specifies the command.  The
       combination of modifier keys is called a modifier chord, by
       analogy with piano keys.  See the <a
       href="general.html#invoking-mouse-commands">Invoking mouse
       commands in editor windows</a> section for more information.
       Chorded keyboard characters are also used as editing commands
       when typing in ICanCAD windows and dialogs; see the <a
       href="general.html#typing-commands">Typing commands to
       ICanCAD</a> section.

       <a name = cltl2>
  <dt> <b>CLtL2</b> (Lisp reference)
  <dd> Popular abbreviation for <b>Common Lisp, the Language, Second
       Edition</b> by Guy L. Steele Jr. (copyright 1990,
       Butterworth-Heinemann, and published under the Digital Press
       imprint).  Most Lisp implementations are somewhere between
       "CLtL2-compliant" and "ANSI-compliant"; modern Lisps are closer
       to the ANSI language, but the CLtL2 specification is still
       relevant, and much more readable for non-implementors.  It has
       many sections that describe "forthcoming" ANSI features, which is
       probably why it hasn't required a third edition.

       <a name = connection-pt>
  <dt> <b>connection point</b>
  <dd> A place on a schematic that involves making a connection to an
       existing bit of wiring.  Connection points highlight as a small
       circle-plus, so that they can be distinguished from ordinary
       points.

       <a name = context>
  <dt> <b>context</b> (of a net)
  <dd> Refers to whether the net is local, global, or a port.  See the
       <a href="busses.html#context">"Net context"</a> section.

  <a name = def>
  <dt> <b>def</b>
  <dd> The basic editable unit of a design.  Some common synonyms used
       by other systems are module, block, (schematic) page, and cell.
       Defs are included hierarchically within each other by means of <a
       href="#use">uses</a>.

  <a name = current-def>
  <dt> <b>def, current</b>
  <dd> The def that will be operated on by most commands.  The
       exceptions are those that specify a def name (e.g. <a
       href="commands.html#com-edit-def">"Edit Def"</a>), in which case
       the named def is used, or that are invoked by clicking the mouse
       in a window, in which case the window's def is obviously meant.
       The current def is always the value of the <tt>*def*</tt>
       variable.  [Generally, this will also be the def displayed in the
       front window, but the code may not be very consistent on this
       point.  -- rgr, 25-Jan-02.]

       <a name = def-name>
  <dt> <b>def name</b>
  <dd> The absolute system-independent name of a def (also,
       <tt>def-name</tt>, the Lisp object that describes it).  See the
       <a href="general.html#library-notes">"Notes on libraries, defs,
       and files"</a> section for details.

       <a name = property-descriptor>
  <dt> <b>descriptor</b> (property)
  <dd> A data structure that describes the attributes of a given
       property, whether primitive or not.  Not all properties need
       descriptors of their own; if a descriptor is not defined, the one
       for the property <tt>default-property</tt> is used.

       <a name = device>
  <dt> <b>device</b>
  <dd> A device is a <a href="#network">network</a> object that
       represents a primitive (e.g. a transistor or capacitor).  These
       are not necessarily IC technology primitives; if the network is
       to be used for functional simulation, it may contain devices that
       represent high-level functional blocks such as memories and
       microprocessors.

       <a name = explicit>
  <dt> <b>explicit</b> (property <a href="#allocation">allocation</a>)
  <dd> A property that is stored on the <tt>basic-thing</tt> property
       list slot when bound.

       <a name = "extraction">
  <dt> <b>extraction</b> (connectivity)
  <dd> [finish.  -- rgr, 18-Jan-03.]

       <a name = frame>
  <dt> <b>frame</b> (n.)
  <dd> [define CLIM term.  -- rgr, 26-Mar-01.]

  <dt> <b>global</b>
  <dd> See <a href="#global-net">net, global</a>.

       <a name = handle>
  <dt> <b>handle</b>
  <dd> A location on a part that can be grabbed (if the part is
       selected) in order to reshape it.  All parts have handles, though
       some (uses and text parts) have only one.

       <a name = keyword>
  <dt> <b>keyword</b> (Lisp)
  <dd> In Lisp, <b>keyword symbols</b> are a subset of symbols that
       start with a single colon, and all belong to the keyword <a
       href="#package">package</a>, <tt>:left</tt> for example.  Unlike
       most Lisp symbols, they do not need to be quoted.

       <br> A <b>keyword argument</b> to a Lisp function [should also be
       defined.  -- rgr, 22-Mar-02].

       <a name = kill-ring>
  <dt> <b>kill ring</b>
  <dd> A history of parts recently deleted.  This is called a "ring"
       because it can be rotated by the <a
       href="commands.html#com-paste-parts">"Paste"</a> command.  See
       the <a href="commands.html#intro-kill-ring">"Kill Ring"</a>
       section for more details.

       <a name = library>
  <dt> <b>library</b>
  <dd> Libraries name a group of related defs, and correspond to
       directories on the file system.  See the <a
       href="libraries.html">"Libraries"</a> section for more
       information.

  <a name = net>
  <dt> <b>net</b>
  <dd> The portion of a single <a href="#node">electrical node</a> that
       falls within a given schematic; a one-wire component of a <a
       href="#bus">bus</a>.  Nets can be connected hierarchically to <a
       href="#port">ports (port nets)</a> of child <a
       href="#use">uses</a>, and, as ports themselves, to nets in
       higher-level schematics; all such nets contribute to the same
       electrical node.

  <a name = global-net>
  <dt> <b>net, global</b>
  <dd> [ugh.  -- rgr, 18-Mar-01.]

  <a name = network>
  <dt> <b>network</b>
  <dd> A network is an ICanCAD object that provides a "flat" description
       of the connectivity of a design hierarchy.  A network consists of
       interconnected <a href="#node">nodes</a> and <a
       href="#device">devices</a>.  See the <a
       href="busses.html#flattening">"Flattening"</a> section for
       details.

  <a name = node>
  <dt> <b>node</b>
  <dd> An electrical node; an equipotential.  Also, the <a
       href="#network">network</a> object that represents a node.
       During simulation, a node has exactly one voltage and/or logic
       state (regardless of how well the simulator may be able to define
       that state).  Thus <tt>GND</tt> is a common node (ahem) that is
       represented by separate <a href="#net">nets</a> in each of the
       schematics that require <tt>GND</tt> connections.

       <a name= package>
  <dt> <b>package</b> (Lisp)
  <dd> The Common Lisp object that serves as a symbol table.  As you
       might therefore expect, a package maps a string to a <a
       href="#symbol">symbol</a>.  The Lisp <tt>*package*</tt> variable
       defines the default package for symbols being read into the Lisp
       system.  See the <a href="general.html#lisp-packages">"Lisp
       packages"</a> section for more details.

       <a name= parameter>
  <dt> <b>parameter</b> (to a <a href="#def">def</a>)
  <dd> ICanCAD supports a limited form of def parameterization, in which
       a def can advertise that certain properties of a use can be
       assigned values in the parent def, and expressions using those
       values can be assigned to parameters of child uses.  It is not
       possible to affect connectivity via ICanCAD parameterization.
       See the <a href="general.html#schematic-parameters">"Passing
       parameters to schematic defs"</a> section for details.

       <a name = pathname>
  <dt> <b>pathname</b> (Common Lisp)
  <dd> A file name, or the object that describes it.  The "path" part
       refers to the series of directory names that form a path from the
       file system root in a fully-specified file name.  See <a
       href="http://www.xanalys.com/software_tools/reference/HyperSpec/Body/chap-19.html">
       Chapter 19</a> of the <a
       href="http://www.xanalys.com/software_tools/reference/HyperSpec/">
       Common Lisp HyperSpec</a> for more on Lisp pathnames.

       <a name = logical-pathname>
  <dt> <b>pathname, logical</b> (Common Lisp)
  <dd> A machine- and operating-system-independent <a
       href="#pathname">pathname</a>, sometimes abbreviated "LPN."  See
       <a href="#cltl2">CLtL2</a> section 23.1.5 for an introduction to
       logical pathnames with examples and a formal description, and <a
       href="http://www.xanalys.com/software_tools/reference/HyperSpec/Body/sec_19-3.html">
       Section 19.3</a> of the <a
       href="http://www.xanalys.com/software_tools/reference/HyperSpec/">
       Common Lisp HyperSpec</a> for a purely formal description.

  <a name = pin>
  <dt> <b>pin</b> (n.)
  <dd> A part in a schematic icon that represents a connection point to
       a schematic <a href="#port">port</a>.  Pins have a text string
       and a "hot spot" that may be positioned independently of each
       other.  The string names the port, and the hot spot identifies
       the connection point.  A <a href="#bristle">bristle</a> will be
       created for each <a href="#use">use</a> of this icon in the same
       relative position as the hot spot.  Each schematic use therefore
       has a set of bristles that corresponds to the use's icon's set of
       pins.  [In reading the code, bear in mind that pins are currently
       implemented by the <tt>icc::port-dot</tt> class.  -- rgr,
       20-Mar-02.]

  <a name = port>
  <dt> <b>port</b>
  <dd> A <a href="#net">net</a> or <a href="#bus">bus</a> within a given
       schematic that is declared as a port becomes part of the
       schematic's electrical interface.  Explicit connections may be
       made to ports when the schematic is added as a use at the next
       higher level of hierarchy.

  <a name="possibility">
  <dt> <b>possibility</b>
  <dd> An item in a list of "possibilities", usually a set of extractor
       errors.  A possibility consists of a message, and a set of parts
       that belong to the same def.  Each possibility can be visited
       independently; the system keeps track of which ones have been
       seen.  [might be good to invent better nomenclature.  -- rgr,
       18-Jan-03.]

       <a name = primitive-prop>
  <dt> <b>primitive</b> (property <a href="#allocation">allocation</a>)
  <dd> A property that is stored in a CLOS object slot.

       <a name= symbol>
  <dt> <b>symbol</b> (Lisp)
  <dd> The Common Lisp object that names variables and functions, among
       other things.  In particular, ICanCAD uses Lisp symbols to name
       properties.  Symbols are normally available in <a
       href="#package">packages</a>.

       <a name = symbolic>
  <dt> <b>symbolic</b> (view, of a part or def)
  <dd> A symbolic part is one with no electrical semantics, such as an
       arc or a rectangle, as opposed to electrically meaningful
       "wiring" parts, such as wires and net labels.  [should mention
       that uses come in symbolic and schematic varieties.  -- rgr,
       31-Mar-02.]  A symbolic def is one that is neither a schematic
       nor a schematic icon.  Symbolic parts can be added to any kind of
       def, as opposed to wiring parts, which are specific to
       schematics, or pins and labels, which are specific to icons.

       <a name = trivial-property>
  <dt> <b>trivial</b> (property)
  <dd> A property is trivial if
       <ul>
	 <li> changing it does not "change" the object (i.e. mark it as
	      modified) when the value changes; and
	 <li> it is not saved to disk or copied when the object is saved
	      or copied, including copying to the kill ring.
       </ul>
       Trivial properties are generally used for storing temporary
       values that should only be associated with the specific part.
       [Whether a property is to be copied or saved may be specified
       independently, so the notion of "trivial" is a bit ambiguous.  --
       rgr, 12-Mar-00.]

       <a name = use>
  <dt> <b>use</b> (n.)
  <dd> A hierarchical inclusion of one <a href="#def">def</a> inside
       another.  Often called an "instance" in other CAD systems, which
       can be confusing to the software developers, who use the term
       "instance" as an object-oriented programming concept.

       <a name = view>
  <dt> <b>view</b> (n.)
  <dd> The "kind" or "purpose" of a def, such as schematic, schematic
       icon, etc.

       <a name = virtual>
  <dt> <b>virtual</b> (property <a href="#allocation">allocation</a>)
  <dd> A property that is computed when requested, rather than being
       stored anywhere.  These are often functions of other properties,
       such as the <tt>area</tt> property of a geometric part.  (The
       <tt>area</tt> of a transistor part may be a different matter, as
       that is probably a <a href="#parameter">parameter</a>.)

       <a name = width>
  <dt> <b>width</b> (adj.)
  <dd> of a bus, the number of bits it contains.

       <a name = active-window>
  <dt> <b>window, active</b>
  <dd> [one that is not deactivated (in the clim sense) because it
       belongs to a <a href="#frame">frame</a> that is currently in a
       configuration that does not use the window.  need to describe
       this in user-meaningful terms.  -- rgr, 26-Mar-01.]
