<h2>Thought on choice of UI toolkit</h2>

<hr>

<p>It seems to me that there are strong parallels between ICanCAD parts and
defs on the one hand, and CLIM output records on the other.  We could
exploit this by designing the appropriate low-level ICanCAD support code
so that it can be used later to support a CLIM clone as well.

<p>
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Similarities</th>
    <th>Differences</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td valign=top> <b>Both are hierarchical</b>, in that output records
	 are contained within other output records.  (See <a
	 href="#note-1">Note 1</a> below.)
    </td>
    <td valign=top> Hierarchy in ICanCAD is shared, with named defs
	 potentially appearing in more than one place in the hierarchy.
	 (This suggests a possible CLIM extension, but it's probably not
	 worth the effort of supporting multiple parents for an output
	 record.)
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td valign=top> <b>Both use similar 2D geometrical concepts</b> such
	 as relative placement through transforms, and bounding boxes.
    </td>
    <td valign=top> The stream orientation of CLIM introduces certain
	 biases, such as top-to-bottom construction and the strong
	 presumption of non-overlap.  A solution that is general enough
	 for ICanCAD may not suit CLIM well.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td valign=top> <b>Sophisticated incremental display update</b>
	 boosts the performance of both ICanCAD (during editing tasks)
	 and CLIM (during incremental update of AVV dialogs).
    </td>
    <td valign=top>
	 Again, the stream orientation of CLIM may interfere.
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

<h3>Notes</h3>

<a name=note-1>
<b>Note 1:</b> In fact, one could argue that ICanCAD hierarchy should be
more like the CLIM hierarchy, in at least one respect.  Schematic uses
could stand to be output-record style collections of one-off component
records for labels and pins (and anything else in the def that is
context dependent).  Pity this can't be per-window . . .
