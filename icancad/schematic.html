<h3>Introduction</h3>

ICanCAD has considerable built-in "smarts" to aid schematic editing.
For example, wires are "stretchy" so that parts can be moved while
maintaining connectivity.  And <a href="#wires">many connections can be
made with a single mouse click.</a>

<p>[I'd like to compare the ICanCAD schematic editing experience to the
Cadence (e.g.) experience, but don't know boo about it.  -- rgr,
8-Feb-02.]

<a name = technology>
<h4>IC technology support</h4>

[currently, there isn't any to speak of.  a technology is just a name in
the <tt>ICANCAD-ATLAS</tt> package,
e.g. <tt>ICANCAD-ATLAS:GENERIC-PROCESS</tt>, stored as the value of the
<tt>technology</tt> property of the def.  see the <a
href="commands.html#com-set-technology">"Set Technology"</a> command.
-- rgr, 8-Feb-02.]

<p>[now there is support for conversion of technology primitives.  these
live in a technology definition file
(e.g. <tt>icancad:process;generic;primitives;generic-process.lisp</tt>
for <tt>GENERIC-PROCESS</tt>), which is autoloaded when a schematic that
uses the technology is first read from disk.  the name of the technology
definition file is stored on the <tt>icc::source-file-name</tt> property
of the technology name.  see the
<tt>icancad:process;generic;primitives;generic-process.lisp</tt> file
for an example, and the <tt>icancad:code;process.lisp</tt> source for
implementation details.  -- rgr, 20-Mar-02.]

<h3>Adding schematic parts</h3>

Here's a series of tips and other information to help create ICanCAD
schematics more efficiently.

<h4>Schematic uses</h4>

[uses create hierarchical refs of one def within another.  -- rgr,
8-Feb-02.]

<p>"Primitive" devices have only an icon; in other words, the child and
the icon are the same def.  [no builtin notion of primitives.  -- rgr,
8-Feb-02.]

<p>Note that uses cannot be connected by placing one so that its
bristle(s) lie atop the bristle(s) of another use; ICanCAD will refuse
to let you stack <a href="glossary.html#bristle">bristles</a> on top of
each other.  Instead, you must use wires to connect them.  However, if
you need to make a series connection between two or more uses, where
each use has two bristles on the same horizontal or vertical line, you
can save time by using the <a href="#wires">speed wiring hack</a>
described below.

<h5>Automatic generation of use names</h5>

Any part can have a name, which is represented by a Lisp symbol, though
normally only uses have names.  Use names are often used to describe
devices within the hierarchy, e.g. <tt>QADC_1.DACWREG_1.R2</tt> to
indicate resistor <tt>R2</tt> within a use named <tt>DACWREG_1</tt>
(presumably the first use of something called <tt>DACWREG</tt>) within
<tt>QADC_1</tt> in the top-level schematic.

<p>Because use names are often needed by external tools, it is wise to
restrict them to a limited character set, using only alphanumerics and
the underscore (<tt>"_"</tt>) character.

<p>When a new use is added to a schematic, it is given a unique name if
it does not already have one, or if its name conflicts with that of
another part within the def.  These names are generated by appending a
decimal number to a prefix; the numbering starts with 1, and the first
unused prefix/number combination so generated is taken as the new use
name.

<p>The prefix should be a string, and is sought in the following places,
in order:
<ol>
  <li> The <tt>use-name-prefix</tt> property of the use's icon def.
  <li> The <tt>use-name-prefix</tt> property of the use's child def
       (which will be the same as the icon for primitives).
  <li> The name component of the child's def name, e.g. the string
       <tt>"foo"</tt> in <tt>"rogers:work:test;foo.sch"</tt>.
</ol>

<p>[I am currently ignoring case issues . . . I hope this doesn't come
back to haunt me.  -- rgr, 8-Feb-02.]

<a name = add-use-commands>
<h5>Commands for adding uses</h5>

The commands for adding uses (including primitives) are as follows:
<ul>
  <li> <a href="commands.html#com-add-use">"Add Use"</a> asks for a def
       name in the interactor pane, which makes this the most general,
       but requires typing.
  <li> <a href="commands.html#com-add-device">"Add Device"</a> puts up a
       menu of technology primitives.
  <li> <a href="commands.html#com-add-loaded-def">"Add Loaded"</a>
       offers to add a def that is currently loaded, via two menus.  The
       first menu allows the user to choose from libraries with loaded
       defs, and the second allows picking a def from the chosen
       library.  [This is most similar to the Janus "Add Use" command.
       -- rgr, 20-Mar-02.]
  <li> <a href="commands.html#com-add-recent-use">"Add Recent"</a> shows
       a menu of defs that have been recently added 
</ul>

<a name = wires>
<h4>Schematic wires</h4>

<p>When running a wire across a use, ICanCAD omits connections between
bristles of the same use, unless the connection explicitly starts with
one bristle and ends with the other.  This allows, for example, the
VDD-to-GND path of an inverter (VDD wire to PMOS drain, PMOS source to
NMOS drain, and NMOS source to GND wire) to be wired using only two
clicks -- one to start the wire, and one to end the wire.  This also
works when "dropping" a use onto an existing wire.

<p>Most ICanCAD libraries are designed to take advantage of this.  Any
number of gate connections to MOS transistors, or base connections to
bipolar devices, can be wired together with only two clicks as above.
This is because all of these transistors are designed with two distinct
gate or base pins.

<p>[Janus has this hack, too, but doesn't make the exception for direct
connections.  We may have to abandon the direct connection feature
ourselves, though; the direct link might get lost during reconnection.
-- rgr, 8-Feb-02.]

<a name = net-label>
<h4>Schematic net labels</h4>

Net labels are placed with the <a
href="commands.html#com-add-net-label">"Add Net Label"</a> command.
They have two vertices, one where wires may connect, and one which
places the text origin.  Stretching the connection point (a.k.a "dot")
moves the text along with it, plus any connected wires, while stretching
the text does not affect the dot at all.

<p>ICanCAD does not support connecting a net label directly to a
bristle; you must add a short wire between the two.  (Janus has the same
restriction.)  This can be done easily for all unconnected bristles of a
use with the <a href="#com-grow-wires">"Grow Wires"</a> command.  [Not
yet implemented, alas.  -- rgr, 20-Mar-02.]

<p>Connecting one net label directly to another is also not allowed, but
if you place two net labels on top of each other, either initially or by
moving one so that its connection point is on top of the other, ICanCAD
combines the two net labels into one that is equivalent.  For example,
if you move <tt>"Foo"</tt> on top of <tt>"Bar"</tt>, you will get a
combined net label with a string of <tt>"Foo = Bar"</tt> (or possibly
<tt>"Bar = Foo"</tt>; one is picked arbitrarily to be first).

<a name = port-icons>
<h5>Drawing port icons for net labels</h5>

<p>The designation of a net as a port or global defines how it is
connected to higher-level parts of the design, but doesn't say much
about how it is used.  In order to distinguish between different types
of port and global nets, the net label can be given a
<tt>:special-property</tt> property, with one of the following values:

<p>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td valign=top>
	 <ul>
	   <li> <tt>:BIDIR</tt>
	   <li> <tt>:INPUT</tt>
	   <li> <tt>:OUTPUT</tt>
	 </ul>
    </td>
    <td valign=top>
	 <ul>
	   <li> <tt>:ANALOG-GROUND</tt>
	   <li> <tt>:CHASSIS-GROUND</tt>
	   <li> <tt>:DIGITAL-GROUND</tt>
	   <li> <tt>:GROUND</tt>
	 </ul>
    </td>
    <td valign=top>
	 <ul>
	   <li> <tt>:POWER-IN</tt>
	   <li> <tt>:POWER-OUT</tt>
	   <li> <tt>:POWER</tt>
	 </ul>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>[The <tt>:special-property</tt> name and concept were taken directly
from Janus.  A name like <tt>net-usage</tt> would be much more
meaningful, but it's too late now.  -- rgr, 20-Mar-02.]

<p>In order to make these kinds of ports and globals readily apparent
when looking at the schematic, they can be drawn using "port icons."  A
port icon is a def that is drawn at the net label's connection point,
and oriented toward the text.  ICanCAD uses the
<tt>*special-property-to-net-label-icon-map*</tt> association list to
map <tt>:special-property</tt> values to port icon names.

<p>For a port icon to be drawn for a given net label, the following must
be true:
<ol>
  <li> The net label must have a value for the
       <tt>:special-property</tt> property that appears on the
       <tt>*special-property-to-net-label-icon-map*</tt> list.  (Since
       the default value for this property is <tt>NIL</tt>, it is
       possible to define an icon for <tt>NIL</tt> and have it appear on
       all net labels that do not have a <tt>:special-property</tt>
       property bound.)
  <li> The associated value must be a string that names a def that
       already exists.
  <li> The bounding box of the def must not overlap that of the net
       label text when the def is drawn with its origin at the
       connection point and its X- axis pointing toward the net label
       text.
</ol>
The standard orientation is therefore with the connection point on the
right and the text on the left.  This will usually be appropriate for
net labels on the left side of a schematic, so ICanCAD will need to
rotate port icons for net labels in other positions.

<p>To customize the port icon for a given <tt>:special-property</tt>
property value, it is only necessary to (a) draw the icon, and (b) put
its name on the <tt>*special-property-to-net-label-icon-map*</tt> alist.
To do the latter, put the following in your <a
href="general.html#startup"> <tt>icancad.lisp</tt> file</a>:
<blockquote>
<pre>
(push '(:bidir . "rogers:scratch:icons;bidir.symbolic")
      *special-property-to-net-label-icon-map*)
</pre>
</blockquote>
This is an example of redefining the icon for bidirectional ports; you
will need to replace <tt>"rogers:scratch:icons;bidir.symbolic"</tt> with
the actual name of your port icon def, and <tt>:bidir</tt> with the
appropriate <tt>:special-property</tt> value.

<h3>Janus compatibility notes</h3>

Be wary of ICanCAD's greater freedom to modify things; some ICanCAD
features will be ignored by Janus, and others may cause Janus to choke.
In particular, Janus does not support reverting icons (i.e. defs with a
<tt>".shape-def"</tt> extension after they have been used from an icon),
so if at all possible, it is better to modify the icon in Janus and
revert in ICanCAD.

<a name = janus-conversion>
<h4>Conversion of Janus defs</h4>

In order to provide a migration path for designs created with the Janus
CAD System, ICanCAD supports two ways to read and convert Janus defs:
<ul>
  <li> <b>"Permanent" conversion</b> produces ICanCAD defs from a Janus
       design hierarchy, which can then be saved in ICanCAD format.
       Permanent conversion is only done explicitly by the "Convert
       Janus Defs" command, and is irreversible (though only because we
       haven't bothered to write a translator for the reverse
       direction).  [This command is not yet implemented; there is as
       yet little incentive to convert permanently.  -- rgr, 11-Feb-02.]
  <li> <b>"In-place" conversion</b> allows Janus defs to be read in such
       a way that then can be converted back when they are edited and
       then saved out again.  In-place conversion happens transparently
       whenever you supply a Janus view to a command, e.g. to edit a
       <tt>".sch"</tt> def, and is what allows ICanCAD to be used as a
       "satellite" Janus design station.
</ul>
In order to remember how defs were converted, permanent conversion
produces defs that use the native ICanCAD view suffixes,
<tt>".schematic"</tt> and <tt>".sicon"</tt>, while in-place conversion
uses the original Janus suffixes, <tt>".sch"</tt> for schematics and
<tt>".shape-def"</tt> for "shape defs" (<a href="#janus-icons">see
below</a> for further details).  When a def with a name that ends in
<tt>".sch"</tt> or <tt>".shape-def"</tt> is saved, ICanCAD knows to
write it in Janus schematic or shape-def format.

<a name = janus-format-subset>
<p>Note that Janus defs are a subset of ICanCAD defs, so it is possible
to add things to or change properties in a def with a name that ends in
<tt>".sch"</tt> or <tt>".shape-def"</tt> that would not get saved.  For
example, changing the color of text or net label parts is pointless, as
it all goes back to black when saved in Janus format.  And circles and
other symbolic parts are not saved at all.  See the <a
href="#janus-compat-other">Other compatibility issues</a> section below
for a more complete list of potential problems.  [We should catch these
cases. i.e. adding unsupported parts to schematics, and issue warnings.
-- rgr, 26-Mar-02.]

<p>[may need to convert libraries separately and completely before a new
Janus-compatible design can be started.  -- rgr, 11-Feb-02.]

<a name = janus-icons>
<h4>Janus icons and shape defs</h4>

In Janus, icons consist of two parts: a "shape def" that contains all of
the drawn geometry, and an icon definition that is saved as a
"deficonshape" descriptor with its own icon name, a string that is
normally the same as the name component of the def name of the
containing schematic.  The deficonshape descriptor would be entirely
redundant except that it may override the port names in the shape def.
When Janus loads a schematic def, it creates an icon object for each
icon definition saved with the schematic.  The icon object, in turn,
refers to its shape def, which is used only for drawing; pins, in
particular, seem to be ignored (except that there does always seem to be
a shape-def pin for each deficonshape pin, at least for icons created
with the current Janus version).  This allows the same shape def to be
used for more than one schematic, even if the schematics have different
sets of ports.  The major drawback is that icons are not full-fledged
defs, which leads to a number of misfeatures in the Janus user
interface, the most annoying of which is that shape defs cannot be
reverted once they are referenced from an icon object.

<p>When instantiating a use of another schematic, Janus uses the full
def name of the schematic (e.g. <tt>"sas:work;qadc.sch.newest"</tt>) and
the icon name (e.g. <tt>"qadc"</tt>) to get the right child/icon
combination.  Because of this, there are two levels of icon naming which
must be mapped into the flat def-name "space" used by ICanCAD icons.
This happens as a byproduct of the renaming process <a
href="#janus-icon-rename">described below</a>.

<p>[I'm still unclear as to whether Janus fully supports multiple icons
per schematic def.  The save format appears to, and I've tried to write
the ICanCAD conversion code to handle multiple icons if present, but I
don't really know if Janus can actually handle multiple icons.  ICanCAD
multiple icon support support is weak at present, but it would be best
not to use it at all if you want backward compatibility with Janus.  --
rgr, 10-Feb-02.]

<p>This somewhat baroque representation evolved over a series of changes
to the internal representation of Janus icons in order to make them
user-editable, and stopped evolving when the implementation became "good
enough," and the implementors gave up on trying to improve the resulting
twisted code.

<p>Needless to say, adopting the Janus model for ICanCAD was not
considered.  Instead, schematics and icons are essentially independent
defs, as long as pins correspond one-to-one with ports by name (see the
<a href="sicon.html#schematic-iface">"Relationship of icons to
schematics"</a> section for details).  ICanCAD icon defs can be shared
between schematics, but only if the port names are the same in all
places.

<a name = janus-icon-rename>
<h4>Conversion of Janus icons</h4>

[this section focuses on in-place conversion, but the process is pretty
much the same for permanent conversion.  -- rgr, 13-Feb-02.]

<p>In order to convert an icon from Janus format, there are two things
that may need to be done beyond simply reading the shape def file (and
thereby converting its parts):
<ol>
  <li> The deficonshape form may respecify the shape def's pins and/or
       bristle labels completely, though usually the changes are limited
       to renaming, sometimes with adjustment of position.  It also
       needs to specify whether a given pin is not to be visible from
       the parent schematic (apparently there is no way to specify this
       in the Janus pin itself).
  <li> The shape def may contain labels that do not correspond to
       parameters of the def it represents.  Janus does not display
       anything for these, but ICanCAD is a bit stricter, and displays
       strings of the form <tt>"&lt;no&nbsp;PROP&gt;"</tt> when property
       <tt>PROP</tt> is not bound on the use.  Since this is annoying
       (at least), such labels are deleted.
</ol>
If either or both of these apply, then the def will need to be modified
in order to serve as an ICanCAD icon.

<p>Strictly speaking, ICanCAD has no way of knowing whether or not there
is another schematic on disk that references a given shape def, so it
should always make a copy of the original shape def in order to rename
its pins and flush unused labels safely.  When doing in-place
conversion, however, this would result in making a new copy every time
the def was read from disk.  Consequently, we copy the def only if it
actually needs to be modified.  If the copy is modified and then saved,
the deficonshape form in the schematic will then refer to the new copy,
and the icon def will be consistent with the newly-generated
deficonshape form in the schematic, so the shape def won't need to be
copied again.  This will be true in Janus as well as ICanCAD (except
that Janus could modify the icon in such a way as to re-introduce
inconsistencies, in which case we'd need to copy again).

<p>[In practice, this appears to mean that schematics will almost always
need to be copied.  Of the 15 schematics under
<tt>sas:work;qadc-top.sch</tt>, all but one had an icon that required
copying.  Most of these appear to have been stupid bristle label
visibility tweaks.  -- rgr, 13-Feb-02.]

<p>In slightly more detail, icon conversion is done as follows:
<ol>
  <li> The original Janus shape def is found.
  <li> If converting in-place, and the deficonshape pins all match the
       shape def pins for text, location, and visibility, then the
       original shape def can be used as-is.
  <li> If converting permanently, and the pins all match, then contents
       of the original shape def can be used, and we need to rename only
       to change the view from <tt>:shape-def</tt> to <tt>:sicon</tt>.
       If a def already exists with this new name, then we assume it was
       previously converted (possibly as a result of converting a
       different schematic that shared it), and we accept it without
       further examination.  [Which could be a mistake.  -- rgr,
       13-Feb-02.]
  <li> Otherwise, there is pin bashing to be done, so we must copy the
       shape def.  If the shape def is modified at this point, then an
       error is signaled, as renaming it will probably not be what you
       expected.  (To work around this, unload or rename the problematic
       def manually, then reissue the command that started the
       conversion.)
  <li> A new name is chosen as described below, and the def is renamed.
       The original name is remembered as the value of the
       <tt>shape-def-name</tt> property for later use.
  <li> All pin updates are made to the "new" icon def, as required by
       the deficonshape form.  Any pins in the icon def that are not
       mentioned in the deficonshape form are deleted.
</ol>
The new icon name is constructed from the icon definition name and the
schematic def name.  The initial candidate name consists of:
<ul>
  <li> the library name from that of the schematic def;
  <li> the name from the icon definition name; and
  <li> the view remains <tt>".shape-def"</tt> for "in-place" conversion,
       or is changed to <tt>".sicon"</tt> for permanent conversion (<a
       href="#janus-conversion">see above</a>).
</ul>
If this def exists, in memory or on disk, we try appending
<tt>"-1"</tt>, <tt>"-2"</tt>, etc., to the name until we find an unused
shape def name, which is then used for the ICanCAD version of the shape
def.

<p>For example, if <tt>a:b:c;nand-2.sch</tt> used
<tt>a:generic;nand2.shape-def</tt> as its <tt>"nand-two"</tt> icon, and
there is no <tt>a:b:c;nand-two.shape-def</tt>, then the original
<tt>a:generic;nand2.shape-def</tt> def would be renamed to
<tt>a:b:c;nand-two.shape-def</tt> in the process of conversion.  When
another Janus def that also used <tt>a:generic;nand2.shape-def</tt> for
its <tt>"nand-2"</tt> icon was converted, <tt>a:c:d:e;nand-2.sch</tt>
for example, <tt>a:generic;nand2.shape-def</tt> would no longer be found
in memory (having been renamed), so a fresh copy would be read from
disk, and would become <tt>a:c:d:e;nand-2.shape-def</tt> (again,
assuming there wasn't a <tt>a:c:d:e;nand-2.shape-def</tt> already).

<p>[<b>Bug:</b> This means that reverting a <tt>".sch"</tt> def with an
icon that requires pin renaming will revert the icon as well -- by
picking a new <tt>".shape-def"</tt> name.  New uses of the schematic
will refer to the new icon(s), but old uses of the schematic will still
refer to the old icons, where "new vs. old" for uses refers to the time
when the Janus schematic was loaded.  It's not clear what the reverse
mapping will do for these uses, so it actually might not be a problem.
-- rgr, 11-Feb-02.]

<h4>Other compatibility issues</h4>

[This is just an outline; I'm trying to make mention of all the issues
in time for the 0.2 release, without overtaxing my fingers.  -- rgr,
19-Mar-02.]

<dl>
  <dt> <b>Janus does not support color.</b>
  <dd> If you save a def in Janus format, it will revert to black and
       white when read back in again.
  <dt> <b>Janus does not fully support symbolic parts in schematics.</b>
  <dd> If you save a <tt>".sch"</tt> def with rectangles, arcs, etc.,
       they will be omitted [silently?].  Text is the only symbolic part
       supported in Janus schematics.
  <dt> <b>ICanCAD and Janus use different internal coordinates.</b>
  <dd> Janus internal coords are ten times bigger.  This sometimes
       causes rounding errors, though usually small ones, since the
       Janus grid is usually 500 or 1000 Janus internal units.  Except
       for IC technology primitives, almost all Janus defs can be
       converted without rounding off.
  <dt> <b>Janus has a more limited notion of text size.</b>
  <dd> Janus uses integer text sizes (from one through ten), whereas an
       ICanCAD text size is a positive real number, i.e. floating point
       values are accepted.  Furthermore, in order to make the apparent
       drawn sizes correspond, the ICanCAD text size numbers are four
       times bigger than those used by Janus.  Fortunately, each system
       is internally consistent in its sizing of pin, net label, and
       symbolic text strings, so there is only one conversion factor.
       However, Janus cannot even express the "in-between" text sizes,
       so if a schematic is saved in <tt>".sch"</tt> format and
       reverted, all text will be rounded to multiples of four.
  <dt> <b>Janus pins do not support the <tt>visible?</tt> property.</b>
  <dd> [this has been kludged around in a number of ways in order to
       make it behave tolerably; expect it to break.  it may help to
       save <tt>".shape-def"</tt> icons before you save their schematic
       defs. -- rgr, 19-Mar-02.]
  <dt> <b>ICanCAD does not support per-use visibility of bristle
       labels.</b>
  <dd> [unimplemented because Martin doesn't seem to use the feature.
       if i turn out to be wrong, when reading a schematic with such a
       use, you'll see a message like <tt>'Warning:&nbsp;&nbsp;LV (800
       200 NIL) matches a pin labelled "Agnd" with visibility T.'</tt>
       -- rgr, 19-Mar-02.]
  <dt> <b>ICanCAD does not support "invisible labels"</b>
  <dd> [what the heck was this supposed to be for?  -- rgr, 19-Mar-02.]
  <dt> <b>Janus ignores labels without bound properties.</b>
  <dd> ICanCAD deletes any such labels when converting, printing an
       appropriate message.  If an ICanCAD label can't find a property,
       e.g. <tt>foo</tt>, on the use for which it is displayed, a
       <tt>"&lt;no&nbsp;FOO&gt;"</tt> message is displayed instead.
  <dt> <b>Some ICanCAD primitive libraries have off-grid pins.</b>
  <dd> What can we do?  We have to live with these libraries for the
       time being.  For this reason, though ICanCAD normally lets you
       wire only to points that are on-grid, an exception is made for
       existing bristles and wires.
  <dt> <b>ICanCAD lets you create hierarchical loops.</b>
  <dd> Such defs will not even load into Janus.
