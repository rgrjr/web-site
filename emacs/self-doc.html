<h3>Summary of self-help commands</h3>

<p>The following is a complete list, based on the results of typing
<tt>"C-h&nbsp;?"</tt>, with hyperlinks to more specific documentation
for the help commands I find most useful.

<ul>
  <b>General documentation:</b>
  <li> <b><tt>C-h&nbsp;a</tt></b> (<a
       href="#apropos"><tt>command-apropos</tt></a> ) -- prompts for a
       substring (actually, a regular expression), and shows a list of
       matching commands (a subset of functions).
  <li> <b><tt>C-h&nbsp;b</tt></b> (<tt>describe-bindings</tt>) --
       displays a table of all key bindings currently in effect.
  <li> <b><tt><i>prefix</i>&nbsp;C-h</tt></b> displays a table of all
       key bindings that start with <tt><i>prefix</i></tt>,
       e.g. <tt>"C-x&nbsp;?"</tt> gives you a list of all commands that
       start with <tt>C-x</tt>.
  <li> <b><tt>C-h&nbsp;i</tt></b> (<a href="#info"><tt>info</tt></a>)
       -- enter the <a href="#info"> <tt>info</tt> documentation
       reader</a>.
  <li> <b><tt>C-h&nbsp;l</tt></b> (<a
       href="#view-lossage"><tt>view-lossage</tt></a>) -- shows the last
       hundred characters you typed.
  <li> <b><tt>C-h&nbsp;p</tt></b> (<tt>finder-by-keyword</tt>) -- Find
       packages matching a given topic keyword.
  <li> <b><tt>C-h&nbsp;t</tt></b> (<tt>help-with-tutorial</tt>) --
       starts the emacs learn-by-doing tutorial.  The tutorial is a file
       that gives you step-by-step instructions on how to edit it.

       <p><b>Specific documentation:</b>
       <br>These are designed to produce more detailed documentation for
       specific items, e.g. commands.
  <li> <b><tt>C-h&nbsp;c</tt></b> (<a
       href="#describe-key"><tt>describe-key-briefly</tt></a>) --
       prompts for a command key sequence, and displays the command
       (function) name.
  <li> <b><tt>C-h&nbsp;k</tt></b> (<a
       href="#describe-key"><tt>describe-key</tt></a>) -- prompts for a
       command key sequence, and displays the full command (function)
       documentation.
  <li> <b><tt>C-h&nbsp;C-k</tt></b>
       (<tt>Info-goto-emacs-key-command-node</tt>) -- prompts for a
       command key sequence, and takes you to the <a
       href="#info"><tt>info</tt></a> documentation node for the command
       bound to that key.
  <li> <b><tt>C-h&nbsp;f</tt></b> (<a
       href="#describe-function"><tt>describe-function</tt></a>) -- Type
       a function name and get documentation of it.
  <li> <b><tt>C-h&nbsp;C-f</tt></b> (<a
       href="#describe-function"><tt>Info-goto-emacs-command-node</tt></a>)
       -- prompts for a function name, and takes you to the <a
       href="#info"><tt>info</tt></a> node for that command.
  <li> <b><tt>C-h&nbsp;v</tt></b> (<tt>describe-variable</tt>) --
       prompts for the name of a variable, and displays the variable's
       documentation and value.
  <li> <b><tt>C-h&nbsp;w</tt></b> (<tt>where-is</tt>) -- prompts for a
       command name, and shows which keystrokes invoke that command.

       the contents of the current mode's syntax table, plus
       explanations of what the codes mean.

       <p><b>Other information:</b>

<h3><tt>C-h&nbsp;i</tt>: The <tt>info</tt> documentation browser</h3>

The <tt>info</tt> online documentation browser is the standard viewer
for <a href="http://www.gnu.org/">all documentation</a> produced by <a
href="http://www.gnu.org/"> the GNU project</a>; much GNU documentation
in addition to that for emacs is usually available online.
<tt>info</tt> documents are written as <tt>.texi</tt> ("texinfo") files,
which can be turned into printed manuals as well as the browsable
<tt>info</tt> form.  Such <tt>info</tt> documents must be installed
properly in order to be available, but the standard installation
procedure for all GNU software also installs its documentation in the
right place.  For example, at <a
href="http://bmerc-www.bu.edu/">BMERC</a>, we have not only both the
user guide and emacs lisp reference, but such tools as <tt>gdb</tt>,
<tt>bison</tt>, and the CMU Common Lisp system are also fully
documented.  And <tt>info</tt> gives you a structured look at the full
text of the printed manuals for these programs; if I had known this when
I started using emacs, I could have saved a few trees.

<p> There are only a handful of <tt>info</tt> commands that are really
essential to learn (a tutorial is available, but hardly necessary).  An
<tt>info</tt> document is a hierarchy of "nodes"; the browser shows you
one node at a time, and the commands are primarily for navigating within
and between nodes.  Here are the basics:

<ul>
  <li> <b><tt>mouse-2</tt></b> -- follows the node reference (menu item,
       cross reference, etc.) clicked on.
  <li> <b><tt>SPC</tt></b> -- scrolls forward to the next screenful, or,
       if at the bottom, moves to the next node.
  <li> <b><tt>n</tt></b> -- moves to the next node.
  <li> <b><tt>DEL</tt></b> -- scrolls backward to the previous screenful, or,
       if at the top of the node, moves to the previous node.
  <li> <b><tt>p</tt></b> -- moves to the previous node.
  <li> <b><tt>u</tt></b> -- moves up to this node's parent.
  <li> <b><tt>m</tt></b> -- prompts for a menu item (with completion),
       and goes to that node.
  <li> <b><tt>.</tt></b> -- go to the top of the current node.
  <li> <b><tt>q</tt></b> -- exit <tt>info</tt> by burying the buffer;
       typing <tt>C-h&nbsp;i</tt> later on will bring back the buffer
       where you left off.
</ul>
There are also commands for searching in the broader document
(i.e. beyond the current node) and the document index; use <a
href="#describe-mode"> <tt>C-h&nbsp;m</tt></a> in <tt>info</tt> to find
them.

<p>One weak point of <tt>info</tt> is that the manuals tend to be fairly
linear (i.e. not hypertextual), a consequence of being produced from the
same markup source as the printed manuals.  But this is greatly relieved
by being easily searchable.  It is common for the top-level "node" for a
manual to reference first what would be the chapters of the printed
edition, and then include a "detailed" listing that includes all of the
third-level nodes (sections) within the chapters.  This makes it easy to
use <tt>C-s</tt> to find the section of interest, then use <tt>m</tt> to
move into that section.  This turns out to be faster than using a paper
index, especially for the emacs manuals, which are more than 500 pages
each in hardcopy.

<p><b>Tip:</b> The <b>GNU Emacs Manual</b> and the <b>GNU Emacs Lisp
Reference Manual</b> are available on the Web as well; see the <a
href="advanced.html#other-advanced">"Other resources for more advanced
emacs"</a> section.

<a name="describe-mode">
<h3><tt>C-h&nbsp;m</tt> Describe the current editing modes</h3>

When you encounter a new editing mode, <tt>C-h&nbsp;m</tt> will help you
find out what mode-specific commands and option settings are available.
For instance, when you edit an HTML document in <a
href="rgr-hacks.html#hhm-commands"> <tt>html-helper-mode</tt></a> and
type <tt>"C-h&nbsp;m"</tt>, you get the following:
<pre>
    The minor modes are described first,
    followed by the major mode, which is described on the last page.
    ^L
    auto-fill-function minor mode (indicator Fill):
    Automatically break line at a previous space, in insertion of text.
    ^L
    HTML helper mode:
    Mode for editing HTML documents.
    For more documentation and the newest version, 
    see <a href="http://www.santafe.edu/~nelson/tools/">http://www.santafe.edu/~nelson/tools/</a>

    The main function html-helper-mode provides is a menu and keybindings
    for the HTML tags one inserts when writing HTML documents. Selecting
    the menu item or typing the key sequence for a command inserts the
    corresponding tag and places point in the right place. If a prefix
    argument is supplied, the tags is instead wrapped around the region.
    Alternately, one can type in part of the tag and complete it with M-TAB.

    There is also code for indentation, timestamps, skeletons for new
    documents, and lots of other neat features.

    key             binding
    ---             -------

    RET		newline-and-indent
    TAB		html-helper-indent-command
    ESC		Prefix Command
    C-c		Prefix Command

    . . .
</pre>

<a name=view-lossage>
<h3><tt>C-h&nbsp;l</tt>: view "lossage"</h3>

Typing <tt>C-h&nbsp;l</tt> shows the last 200 characters typed, which can be a 
big plus after typos with the control key held down.  If you look through 
the list to see where you goofed, you can type <tt>C-h&nbsp;c</tt> to find out 
what those keys are called (strictly speaking, the name of the command to 
which they are bound).  Many times I've learned new commands this way!

<a name="describe-function">
<h3><tt>C-h&nbsp;f</tt> and <tt>C-h&nbsp;C-f</tt>: Document a command or function by name</h3>

After prompting for a function name (typed with completion),
<tt>C-h&nbsp;f</tt> shows the full code documentation in a separate
window.  (Remember that every emacs command is implemented by an
underlying function.)  <tt>C-h&nbsp;C-f</tt> is similar, but brings up
the function documentation in the <a href="#info"><tt>info</tt>
browser</a>, which makes it possible to get more context than
<tt>C-h&nbsp;f</tt> can give you (e.g. what other similar commands are
available).  The commands described in the next section
(<tt>C-h&nbsp;c</tt>, <tt>C-h&nbsp;k</tt>, and <tt>C-h&nbsp;C-k</tt>) do
the same thing given the sequence of keys you use to invoke the command.
Taken together, these commands are indispensible for getting full
details of exactly what the command does, including special cases, and
how it uses the numeric argument (if it does).

<a name=describe-key>
<h3><tt>C-h&nbsp;c</tt>, <tt>C-h&nbsp;k</tt>, and <tt>C-h&nbsp;C-k</tt>: Document a command by keystrokes</h3>

<tt>C-h&nbsp;c</tt> prompts for a key sequence, as if you were actually
invoking a command, and tells you the name of the command that runs when
you type those keys.  <tt>C-h&nbsp;k</tt> prompts for a key sequence and
gives you the full function documentation, as by <tt>C-h&nbsp;f</tt>
(see above).  And <tt>C-h&nbsp;C-k</tt> takes you to the relevant
section of the online manual, as by <tt>C-h&nbsp;C-f</tt>.  (Ironically,
typing <tt>"C-h C-k C-h C-k"</tt> doesn't work, in either emacs 19.34 or
20.3; this has been reported as a bug.)  Remember that the command
specified by a key sequence will depend on the editing mode; typing
<tt>TAB</tt> invokes <tt>self-insert-command</tt> in fundamental mode,
as you might expect, but does <tt>indent-for-lisp</tt> in Lisp mode and
<tt>indent-for-c</tt> in C mode.

<p>The commands described in <a href="#describe-function">the previous
section</a> (<tt>C-h&nbsp;f</tt> and <tt>C-h&nbsp;C-f</tt>) do the same
thing given the command or function name.  Taken together, these
commands are indispensible for getting full details of exactly what the
command does, including special cases, and how it uses the numeric
argument (if it does).

<a name="apropos">
<h3><tt>C-h&nbsp;a</tt>: Apropos commands</h3>

[finish; also document <tt>apropos</tt> and <tt>apropos-do-all</tt>.  --
