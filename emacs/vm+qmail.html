<p>This page describes <tt>vm+qmail</tt>, for people running <a
href="http://www.wonderworks.com/vm/"> <tt>vm</tt></a> with <a
href="http://www.qmail.org/"><tt>qmail</tt></a> (on a Unix or <a
href="/linux/">Linux</a> system).

<h3>What are they?</h3>

<dl>
  <dt> <b><a href="http://www.qmail.org/"><tt>qmail</tt></a> is a mail
       transfer agent (MTA) for Unix.</b>
  <dd> If your mail is delivered via <tt>qmail</tt>, then there are many
       neat things you can do.  Here are two of them:
       <ol>
	 <li> You can subscribe to mailing lists using distinct return
	      addresses so that mail from each list is delivered to a
	      separate inbox.
	 <li> You can use <tt>Maildir</tt> format for your inboxes,
	      instead of the traditional Unix mbox format that suffers
	      from the standard concurrency bugs.
       </ol>
       Not all mail readers handle these features well, though.

       <p>
  <dt> <b><a href="http://www.wonderworks.com/vm/">The <tt>vm</tt>
       package</a> allows you to read mail within <a
       href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/emacs.html">emacs</a>.</b>
  <dd> <tt>vm</tt> is a modern MIME-aware mail-reading program (also
       called a mail user agent or MUA) with many powerful features, in
       addition to the convenience of being integrated into the emacs
       editor.
       <ol>
	 <li> <tt>vm</tt> allows you to assign a distinct inbox to each
	      of several folders, but then it's harder to know whether
	      you have new mail waiting.
	 <li> <tt>vm</tt> version 6.75 doesn't handle <tt>Maildir</tt>
	      format natively.
       </ol>

       <p>
  <dt> <b><tt>vm+qmail</tt> improves integration between the two.</b>

<h3>Downloading and Installation</h3>

<a name=lists>
<h3>Customizing mailing list return addresses</h3>

To have mail from mailing lists come to separate mailbox/Maildir files,
one subscribes to the list using a return address such as
<tt>rogers-netatalk</tt> that starts with your user name and ends with
an extension that is typically the mailing-list name. . . .

<a name=commands>
<h3>Commands</h3>

<ul>
  <li> <b><tt>M-x&nbsp;v+q-mbox-status</tt></b> reports on any incoming
       messages currently sitting in mailbox files or Maildir
       directories (so the command name is really a bit of a misnomer).
       The set of files/directories examined is controllde by the
       <tt>v+q-mbox-directory</tt> and <tt>v+q-mbox-regexp</tt>
       variables, which default to <tt>"~/"</tt> and
       <tt>"^Mailbox\\|^Maildir"</tt>, respectively.  If a directory is
       matched, it is assumed to be a Maildir; otherwise, it is assumed
       to be an mbox-format file.  In either case the total number of
       messages are counted, and summarized in a line that looks like:
       <pre>
  1 message in ~/Mailbox, 13 in ~/Mailbox.bugtraq, 8 in ~/Maildir.netatalk</pre>
       Messages are reported regardless of whether the box or directory
       appears as an inbox in the <tt>vm-spool-files</tt> list.  Doesn't
       handle POP or IMAP drops.
  <li> <b><tt>M-x&nbsp;v+q-set-mailing-list-user</tt></b> -- [finish
       after "Customizing" section above.  -- rgr, 9-Jul-00.]
  <li> <b><tt>M-x&nbsp;v+q-generate-password</tt></b> generates a
       password using alphanumerics plus unshifted special characters.
       It will be echoed in the message area; see the
       <tt>*Messages*</tt> buffer if you want to cut-and-paste it
       somewhere.  The default length is 8 characters long, unless you
       give the command a numeric argument.  If the argument is
       negative, it will produce something that doesn't use shift keys
       at all (i.e. no uppercase letters).  [This is part of
       <tt>vm+qmail</tt> for no particular reason.  -- rgr, 9-Jul-00.]
</ul>

<h3>Maildir support for <tt>vm</tt></h3>

[needs <a href="vm-7.17-rgr.patch">a patch to <tt>vm</tt></a> in
addition to <tt>vm+qmail</tt>.  -- rgr, 10-Jan-04.]
