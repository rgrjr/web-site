Workspace</a> : Bootcamp preparation
<hr>

<p>This page describes things you can do before arriving at <a
href="http://bootcamp.arsdigita.com/">bootcamp</a> in order to ensure
that you hit the ground running.  These fall into two categories: Coming
up to speed on fundamental technology, and reading ahead.

<a name = basic-tools>
<h2>Basic tools</h2>

<a name = emacs>
<h3>The emacs text editor</h3>

At bootcamp, you will be spending most of your time in <a
href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/emacs.html"> the emacs text
editor</a>, editing Tcl scripts, SQL code, HTML, server init files, etc.
<ul>
  <li> If you are not at least comfortable with using emacs, an
       afternoon working through a tutorial would be well spent.  We
       have collected an <a href="">emacs tips</a> page that should give
       you a good start.
  <li> If you are a fluent emacs user, but haven't had experience
       editing HTML (and WYSIWYG editing doesn't count when you are
       preparing to write code that writes HTML), you might find it
       worthwhile to experiment with editing HTML constructs in emacs;
       <a href="#html">see below</a> for suggestions.
</ul>

<a name = unix>
<h3>The Unix operating system</h3>

Perhaps surprisingly, you don't need to know much about Unix to get
through the bootcamp.  The vast majority of Unix commands you will never
see, and you will be given appropriate cookbook recipes for the others.

<p>On top of that, if you don't already have access to Unix, then
getting access would be more trouble than it's worth.  And if you
<i>do</i> have access, then you probably already know enough Unix
already.

<p>Besides, if you ever get stuck with a Unix problem at bootcamp, you
can always ask the guru sitting at the next console.

<a name = tcl>
<h3>The Tcl programming language</h3>

It is not strictly necessary to tackle Tcl before the bootcamp, since
Tcl is quite a compact language, so it is possible to learn quickly.
However, most people also find Tcl an ugly little runt of a language,
full of odd syntax rules and semantic gotchas.  This makes the early
part of the learning curve quite steep, so if you can get past that
point before arriving at bootcamp, you will be well ahead of the game.

<p>[see also Colin Roald's <a
href="http://gungeralv.org/roald/tech/utilities-tcl.html"> utilities.tcl
cheat sheet</a>.  -- rgr, 14-Oct-99.]

<p>[download instructions.  -- rgr, 26-Sep-99.]  [look at <a
href="http://www.primenet.com/~cohen/arsdigita/problem_set_zero.html#Tcl">
the Tcl material</a> on <a
href="http://www.primenet.com/~cohen/arsdigita/problem_set_zero.html">
David Cohen's "Problem Set Zero"</a> page.  -- rgr, 2-Oct-99.]

<p>Once you have access to a working Tcl interpreter, you could consider
doing the first excercise of <a
href="http://photo.net/teaching/psets/ps1/ps1.adp">Problem Set 1</a>.

<a name = html>
<h3>The HTML markup language</h3>

HTML is not hard to play with; you can edit HTML files (preferably <a
href="#emacs"> in emacs</a>), save them to disk, and then use your
browser's <tt>"file:"</tt> pseudo-URL syntax to see how they look.  You
could start by saving this page locally, and improving the formatting in
your copy.  (This shouldn't be too hard.)

<p>What do all those <tt>&lt;h1&gt;</tt> and <tt>&lt;ol&gt;</tt> things
mean?  For a quick reference to HTML, check out <a
href="http://werbach.com/barebones/barebone.html">The Bare Bones Guide
to HTML</a>.  Be sure to stay away from markup tags labelled "4.0" and
"MS"; not all browsers will support these.  This guide also has <a
href="http://werbach.com/web/wwwhelp.html">extensive links to other
resources</a>.

<h3>The SQL database query sublanguage</h3>

Like <a href="#unix">Unix</a>, getting to the point where you can
actually use SQL before arriving at bootcamp is not worth the trouble.
Just skim <a href="http://photo.net/sql/">SQL for Web Nerds</a> if you
want some idea of what you need to know.  (Don't try to read anything
else; the other books on SQL I've seen either cover too much
information, or do not cover the right version of Oracle, or both.)

<a name = hints>
<h2>Hints on problem sets</h2>

<ul>
  <li> <a href="overlap.html">Overlapping intervals</a>
</ul>

<a name = reading>
<h2>Reading materials</h2>

<a name = free-reading>
<h3>Free stuff</h3>

<ul>

       completeness)
  <li> <a href="http://6916.lcs.mit.edu/manuals/tcl/">Tcl for Web
       Nerds</a> (tutorial for the Tcl language; in rough shape right
       now and you might consider using <a href="#welch">the Welch book
       (below)</a>).  Other Web sources:

       <p>
       <ul>
	 <li> <a href="http://www.scriptics.com">www.scriptics.com</a> has some

	      edition of the Welch book is available as Postscript</a>

	      the version compiled into AOLserver 2.3)
	 <li> <a href="http://www.aolserver.com">www.aolserver.com</a>

	      have more tutorial-oriented information, presented in the
	      context of Aolserver development.  (This material is also
	      available as the <a
	      href="http://www-md.fsl.noaa.gov/eft/developer/tcltk-man-html/TclCmd/contents.htm">
	      Tcl Commands</a> reference, which presents the identical

<h3>Not-free stuff that you might want to buy</h3>

<ul>       
  <li> <a
       href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0961392126/photonetA/">

       Oracle 8: The Complete Reference</a> (more concise than the online
       Oracle docs).  [But don't attempt to read this before starting
       the course; you will get lost in detail you'll never need.  --

  <li> <a
       href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0136168302/photonetA/">
       Practical Programming in Tcl and Tk</a> (Brent Welch 1997;
