Customization
<hr>

<p>[this section is under construction.  it's well-covered in the emacs
texinfo doc, though, so i may decide not to finish it.  -- rgr,
22-May-00.]

<p>There are many ways to customise emacs, including the following, from
simplest to most complicated:
<ol>
  <li> Setting variables.
  <li> Rebinding keys.
  <li> Writing keyboard macros.
  <li> Defining hook functions.
  <li> Writing emacs lisp code.
</ol>
All of these can be put in your <tt>.emacs</tt> file so that they
persist from session to session.

<h3>The <tt>.emacs</tt> file</h3>

emacs loads the <tt>.emacs</tt> file from your home directory every time
you start emacs.  This file should contain a series of emacs lisp
<b>expressions</b>
(also known as <b>forms</b> or, more obscurely, <b>symbolic
expressions</b> or <b>sexps</b>), each of which is <b>evaluated</b> in
turn.  Each expression is of the form:
<ul>
  <li> a self-defining constant (integer, floating point number, or
       string surrounded by double quotes);
  <li> [finish]
</ul>

<a name=set-var>
<h3>Setting variables</h3>

Variables may be set with the <tt>M-x&nbsp;set-variable</tt> command,
which prompts for the variable name, and then a value.

<a name=rebind-keys>
<h3>Rebinding keys</h3>

<pre>
	(global-set-key "\C-cb" 'bury-buffer)
</pre>
or, for a keybinding that is specific to <tt>mail-mode</tt>:
<pre>
	(define-key mail-mode-map "\C-cb" 'bury-buffer)
</pre>

<a name=kbd-mac>
<h3>Writing keyboard macros</h3>

Since you can bind a string of characters that invoke commands to a key,
the way to save a keyboard macro is like this:
<pre>
	(global-set-key "\C-cf" "This is some inserted text.
	It occupies two lines\n")
</pre>
Remember that ordinary characters are commands that insert themselves.

<a name=hook-fns>
<h3>Defining hook functions</h3>

<a name=writing-code>
<h3>Writing emacs lisp code</h3>

If you've been keeping up with the preceding discussion, then you're
already reading emacs lisp code.

<p>The minimum command would look like this:
<pre>
	(defun foo-command ()
	  (interactive)
	  (insert "This is some inserted text.
	It occupies two lines\n"))
	(global-set-key "\C-cf" 'foo-command)
</pre>
You could then invoke foo-command by typing <tt>"C-c&nbsp;f"</tt>, in
any buffer.
