<a name=shell-mode>
<h3>Running a shell within emacs</h3>

emacs supports a mode called <tt>shell-mode</tt> (with variants) that
let you run a command interpreter in an emacs buffer.
(<tt>shell-mode</tt> is as opposed to <tt>sh-mode</tt> (aka
<tt>shell-script-mode</tt>), which is for editing shell scripts.)  Other
modes with similar functionality (e.g. <tt>matlab-shell</tt> provided by
<tt>matlab-mode.el</tt>, the Lisp dialects supported by <a
href="http://www2.cons.org/ilisp/">the <tt>ilisp</tt> package</a>) are
usually built on top of this, and provide a similar user interface.

<p><b>Commands:</b>
<ul>
  <li> <b><tt>M-x&nbsp;shell</tt></b> starts a shell in the buffer named
       "*shell*", or selects that buffer if it already exists.  You can
       use normal emacs editing commands to input a command; typing
       <tt>RET</tt> sends the command to the shell.  To create multiple
       shell buffers, simply keep renaming "*shell*" to something else
       (e.g. via <tt>M-x&nbsp;rename-buffer</tt> or
       <tt>M-x&nbsp;rename-uniquely</tt>).
  <li> <b><tt>M-x&nbsp;rsh</tt></b> prompts for a host name, and starts
       a remote shell via rsh in the buffer named "*rsh-<i>host</i>*",
       or selects that buffer if it already exists.
  <li> <b><tt>M-x&nbsp;telnet</tt></b> prompts for a host name, and
       starts a telnet session in the buffer named
       "*telnet-<i>host</i>*", or selects that buffer if it already
       exists.

       <p>Command input:
  <li> <b><tt>RET</tt></b> also sends a previously typed command to the
       shell if typed on a line before the current prompt.  So you can
       use <tt>C-r</tt> to search backward for a command close to what
       you need, edit the command in the transcript, and invoke it via
       <tt>RET</tt>.
  <li> Alternatively, <b><tt>C-c&nbsp;RET</tt></b> on a previous line is
       like <tt>RET</tt>, but the command is just copied to the prompt
       without sending, allowing further editing.
  <li> <b><tt>M-p</tt></b> inserts the previous command (when at the
       shell prompt).  Repeated invocation of <tt>M-p</tt> cycles
       through the command history, or you can use a numeric argument to
       get the Nth previously typed command.
  <li> <b><tt>M-n</tt></b> is like <tt>M-p</tt> but gets the next
       command, cycling backward through the command history.
  <li> <b><tt>M-r</tt></b> is like <tt>M-p</tt>, but prompts for a
       regular expression and inserts the Nth previous matching command
       (named by analogy with <tt>C-r</tt>).
  <li> <b><tt>M-s</tt></b> is like <tt>M-n</tt> but prompts for a
       regular expression and inserts the Nth subsequent matching
       command (named by analogy with <tt>C-s</tt>).
  <li> <b><tt>TAB</tt></b> attempts to complete the file name before
       point.

       <p>Job control:
  <li> <b><tt>C-c&nbsp;C-c</tt></b> interrupts the currently running
       shell command.
  <li> <b><tt>C-c&nbsp;C-d</tt></b> sends an EOF to the currently
       running shell command.
  <li> <b><tt>C-c&nbsp;C-z</tt></b> suspends the currently running shell
       command (but you have to use shell job control to resume it).

       <p>Miscellaneous:
  <li> <b><tt>C-c&nbsp;n</tt></b> goes to the next prompt.
  <li> <b><tt>C-c&nbsp;p</tt></b> goes to the previous prompt.
  <li> <b><tt>C-M-l</tt></b> moves to the start of the output of the
       last command, putting it at the top of the window.
  <li> <b><tt>M-x&nbsp;dirs</tt></b> tells emacs to ask the shell what
       its current directory is.  (emacs tries to make the default
       directory of the buffer track the shell's working directory, but
       sometimes it gets confused.)
</ul>

<a name=man>
<h3>Viewing <tt>man</tt> pages</h3>

Most Unix command and system API documentation comes in the form of
"<tt>man</tt> pages," which are available online by invoking the
<tt>man</tt> command<a href="#pager-fn0">[0]</a>.  emacs provides a user
interface to <tt>man</tt> that formats the page (which may actually be
many pages if printed) and puts it in a buffer, where you can search,
scroll, print, cut & paste, etc.  Successive <tt>M-x&nbsp;man</tt>
invocations result in successive buffers, which can be viewed in
parallel.

<p><b>Commands:</b>
<ul>
  <li> <b><tt>M-x&nbsp;man</tt></b> prompts for a command or function
       name, formats the page into its own buffer, and views it in
       another window.  If the page has already been formatted (i.e. the
       buffer exists), <tt>M-x&nbsp;man</tt> just puts the buffer in the
       other window, leaving the cursor where you saw it last.  The
       manpage buffers are read-only, so most commands do not require
       the control or meta modifiers.

       <p><b>Within a manpage buffer:</b>
  <li> <b><tt>SPC</tt></b> -- Scrolls forward (or type <tt>C-M-v</tt> or
       <tt>M-next</tt> from the other window; <tt>next</tt> may be
       labelled "Page Down").
  <li> <b><tt>DEL</tt></b> -- Scrolls backward (or type <tt>M-prior</tt>
       from the other window; <tt>prior</tt> may be labelled "Page Up").
  <li> <b><tt>m</tt></b> -- Prompt to retrieve a new manpage (i.e. a
       shortcut for <tt>"M-x&nbsp;man"</tt>).
  <li> <b><tt>r</tt></b> -- Retrieve reference in SEE ALSO section.
  <li> <b><tt>M-n</tt></b> -- Jump to next manpage in circular list.
  <li> <b><tt>M-p</tt></b> -- Jump to previous manpage in circular list.
  <li> <b><tt>n</tt></b> -- Jump to next manpage section.
  <li> <b><tt>p</tt></b> -- Jump to previous manpage section.
  <li> <b><tt>g</tt></b> -- Go to a manpage section.
  <li> <b><tt>s</tt></b> -- Jumps to the SEE ALSO manpage section.
  <li> <b><tt>q</tt></b> -- Deletes the manpage window, bury its buffer.
  <li> <b><tt>k</tt></b> -- Deletes the manpage window, kill its buffer.
</ul>

<h4>Why I don't use pagers: A digression</h4>

<p>If you invoke <tt>man</tt> from a shell (as the hardcore Unix hackers
do), then the formatted manual page comes to the standard output, flying
rapidly off the top of the window<a href="#pager-fn1">[1]</a>.  In order
to be able to actually read the page, it used to be that one had to pipe
the output through a "pager" program, e.g. <tt>more</tt> (or the FSF
analogue <tt>less</tt>), which stopped and prompted the user after each
screenful, and also allowed context searching, among other features.  It
amazes me that even now, with bitmapped displays and cheap memory,
people still use such things<a href="#pager-fn2">[2]</a>.  Given that I
am already in emacs, I find it so much easier to use the shell buffer
for running shell commands, and to look at <tt>man</tt> pages in
<tt>man-mode</tt> buffers using the <tt>M-x&nbsp;man</tt> command.

<p>Similarly, instead of doing <tt>"ls -l | less"</tt> to see a
long-format directory listing of the current directory, in emacs you can
do <tt>"M-x&nbsp;dired RET RET"</tt> (or <tt>"C-x&nbsp;d&nbsp;RET"</tt>)
to see the same listing in a "dired mode" buffer.  The dired buffer can
be scrolled forward and backward as by <tt>less</tt>, and searched
somewhat more efficiently.  Better still, dired mode also allows you to
manipulate the files (edit, rename, delete, change permissions, etc.)
with single-character commands.  See the <a href="#dired">"Editing
directory listings with <tt>C-x&nbsp;d</tt>"</a> section for more
information.

<p>The other approach is to turn off paging entirely (by doing
<tt>"setenv PAGER cat"</tt> in <tt>csh</tt>), and view the whole
<tt>man</tt> page or <tt>ls</tt> listing in the shell buffer.  But for
most purposes, I find it easier to keep these in separate buffers, where
they are randomly accessible and don't interfere with whatever I'm
trying to accomplish in the shell.

<p>Note that it doesn't make a difference whether you are running emacs
under a graphical user interface, or through the rawest terminal
emulator over a telnet connection.  The emacs user interface looks
almost the same, and a pager is more of a hindrance than a help in
either case.

<p><b>Footnotes:</b>

<dl compact>
  <a name= pager-fn0>
  <dt> [0]
  <dd> Note that the <a href="http://www.fsf.org/">Free Software
       Foundation</a> considers <tt>man</tt> pages obsolescent,
       preferring <tt>info</tt> documents instead, so this statement is
       less true of (e.g.) <a
       href="http://www.fsf.org/gnu/linux-and-gnu.html"> GNU/Linux
       systems</a> than of "traditional" Unix distributions.  Although
       the FSF ships <tt>man</tt> pages with most of their applications,
       the <tt>info</tt> documentation is usually more complete, often
       containing tutorial material with examples, and may be more
       up-to-date.

       <p>
       <a name= pager-fn1>
  <dt> [1]
  <dd> Newer versions of <tt>man</tt> invoke the pager for you, unless
       you explicitly say otherwise, so this is no longer strictly true.
       It used to be that you had to explicitly pipe the output of
       <tt>man</tt> through the pager:
       <pre>
       man cmdname | more
</pre>
       But on most systems, this is no longer necessary.

       <p>
       <a name = pager-fn2>
  <dt> [2]
  <dd> OK, even I find it necessary to use a pager now and then when I'm
       using the raw console TTY in single-user mode.  But even in those
       rare cases, it's usually more convenient to do it all within
       emacs.

<h3>Editing Tcl source code</h3>

[in progress]

<p><b>Commands:</b>
<ul>
  <li> <b><tt>M-x&nbsp;tcl-mode</tt></b>
  <li> <b><tt>M-x&nbsp;inferior-tcl</tt></b> (<tt>C-c&nbsp;C-t</tt> in a

</ul>

<a name=dired>
<h3>Editing directory listings with <tt>C-x&nbsp;d</tt></h3>

<tt>dired</tt> is another extremely useful useful emacs feature that
provides the ability to "edit" directories as if they were
specially-formatted files.  When <tt>dired</tt> is invoked, usually by
typing <tt>C-x&nbsp;d</tt>, it asks for the name of a directory, and
then shows the contents of that directory as a "long"
(<tt>"ls&nbsp;-l"</tt>) format listing, indented by two spaces.  Files
can then be manipulated, and subdirectories opened, by using
single-character commands.  Two styles of operation are supported:
immediate operations, and mark-now/execute-later.

<p><tt>dired</tt> is an ancient and well-developed feature of emacs; the
summary below only scratches the surface of what it can do.  [and needs
more work in any case.  -- rgr, 19-Feb-01.]

<p><b>Commands:</b>
<ul>
  <li> <b><tt>C-x&nbsp;d</tt></b> -- enters <tt>dired</tt> mode in the
       current window, after prompting for a directory name.
  <li> <b><tt>C-x&nbsp;4&nbsp;d</tt></b> (<tt>dired-other-window</tt>)
       -- enters <tt>dired</tt> mode in the other window, after
       prompting for a directory name.

       <p><b>Immediate commands:</b>
  <li> <b><tt>C</tt></b> (<tt>dired-do-copy</tt>) --
  <li> <b><tt>D</tt></b> (<tt>dired-do-delete</tt>) --
  <li> <b><tt>G</tt></b> (<tt>dired-do-chgrp</tt>) --
  <li> <b><tt>M</tt></b> (<tt>dired-do-chmod</tt>) --
  <li> <b><tt>O</tt></b> (<tt>dired-do-chown</tt>) --
  <li> <b><tt>P</tt></b> (<tt>dired-do-print</tt>) --
  <li> <b><tt>R</tt></b> (<tt>dired-do-rename</tt>) --
  <li> <b><tt>X</tt></b> (<tt>dired-do-shell-command</tt>) -- prompts
       for and runs a shell command on the specified file(s).
  <li> <b><tt>Z</tt></b> (<tt>dired-do-compress</tt>) --
</ul>

<a name=meta-dot>
<h3>Finding definitions in source code with <tt>M-.</tt></h3>

Once you set it up properly, emacs can cruise through source code
hypertext style.

<p><b>Commands:</b>
<ul>
  <li> <b><tt>M-.</tt></b> (<tt>find-tag</tt>) prompts for a definition
       name, and searches for it in the set of known tags tables.  The
       first definition is brought up in the current emacs window;
       typing <b><tt>C-u&nbsp;M-.</tt></b> brings you to the next
       matching definition.  (Matching is done with string searching, so
       you don't have to supply the full name, but short names tend to
       find spurious definitions.)
  <li> <b><tt>M-x&nbsp;visit-tags-table</tt></b> introduces a new tags table
       (see below).
  <li> <b><tt>C-x&nbsp;4&nbsp;.</tt></b>
       (<tt>find-tag-other-window</tt>) is like <tt>M-.</tt>, but shows
       the definition in the other window.
</ul>

<p><b>Setting up:</b>

<p>This sets up a tags table, conventionally called <tt>TAGS</tt>, for
finding stuff in a given directory.  Let's assume that the
<tt>"~/c-prog/"</tt> directory contains a program written in C.

<ol>
  <li> Go to the appropriate directory, and make the tags table:
       <pre>
       cd ~/c-prog
       etags *.[ch]
</pre>
       You need to create the <tt>TAGS</tt> file initially, and may need
       to redo it periodically if emacs can't find something (usually
       because you've moved a definition from one file to another).

       <p>
  <li> Visit the tags table in emacs:
       <pre>
       M-x visit RET ~/c-prog/ RET
</pre>
       If you are already in the <tt>~/c-prog/</tt> directory, then
       <tt>M-x&nbsp;visit RET RET"</tt> will be sufficient.  In any
       case, you must do this every time you restart emacs.

       <p>
  <li> Or, to get this tags table automatically every time you restart
       emacs, put
       <pre>
       (setq tags-table-list (list (expand-file-name "~/c-prog/TAGS")))
</pre>
       in your <tt>.emacs</tt> file.
</ol>

Once you've set up one of your program directories this way, try
<tt>M-.</tt> on one of the function names to test it out.
<tt>etags</tt> understands C, Perl, Lisp, Fortran, Pascal, and a host of
other programming languages.

<p>If you install the <a href="rgr-hacks.html#rgr-mouse">mouse commands
in the <tt>rgr-hacks</tt> package</a>, you can click <tt>M-mouse-1</tt>
(that is, hold down the "Meta" modifier while clicking the left mouse
button) to invoke <tt>find-tag</tt> on the definition name under the
mouse.

<p><b>Setting up an <a
href="http://photo.net/teaching/boot-camp.html">ArsDigita bootcamp</a>
machine:</b>

<p>This sets up a tags table, conventionally called <tt>TAGS</tt>, for
finding stuff in the ACS system, as modified by you on your machine.
You should be able to do this with a command like
<tt>"etags&nbsp;*.tcl"</tt>, but <tt>etags</tt> doesn't know about Tcl
syntax, and certainly not about <tt>proc_doc</tt>, hence the arcana.

<ol>
  <li> Copy <a href="makefile.text">the sample makefile</a> to your
       top-level server directory (<tt>/web/studentXX/</tt>), renaming
       it from <tt>makefile.text</tt> to <tt>makefile</tt>.  You only
       need to do this once.

       <p>
  <li> Go to the server directory, and make the tags table:
       <pre>
       cd /web/studentXX/
       make
</pre>
       You need to initialize this once, and may need to redo it
       periodically if emacs can't find something (because you've moved
       a definition from one file to another, etc.).

       <p>
  <li> Visit the tags table in emacs:
       <pre>
       M-x visit RET /web/student<i>XX</i>/ RET
</pre>
       You must do this every time you restart emacs.

       <p>
  <li> Or, to get this tags table automatically every time you restart
       emacs, put
       <pre>
       (setq tags-table-list '("/web/student<i>XX</i>/TAGS"))
</pre>
       in your <tt>.emacs</tt> file.

       <p>
  <li> Try <tt>"M-.&nbsp;ad_permission_p&nbsp;RET"</tt> to test it out.
</ol>

<a name=grep>
<h3>Finding regular expressions in source code</h3>

The Unix <tt>grep</tt> command may be used to search for regular
expressions in source files.  For example,
<pre>
    grep -n 'room-view' *.tcl
</pre>
finds all occurrences of the string "room-view" in all tcl files in the
current buffer's default directory (so it matters what buffer you're in
when you invoke this command).  These are presumably links that invoke
the <tt>room-view.tcl</tt> script.  <tt>grep</tt> uses a more powerful
regular expression language than tcl (but not as powerful as emacs or
perl); see <tt>"M-x&nbsp;man&nbsp;RET&nbsp;grep&nbsp;RET"</tt> for more
information.

<p>By itself, <tt>grep</tt> is quite useful, but emacs makes it more
so.  <tt>M-x&nbsp;grep</tt> runs <tt>grep</tt> itself to search for
occurrences of a regular expression in a set of files, putting the
result in a buffer.  Then, <tt>C-x&nbsp;`</tt> visits the lines where
the regular expression matches (called "hits") one at a time.

<p><b>Commands:</b>
<ul>
  <li> <b><tt>M-x&nbsp;grep</tt></b> prompts for a <tt>grep</tt> command
       to execute, complete with regular expression and some indication
       of which files to search, usually a wildcarded file name in the
       current directory.  The resulting hits are put in a buffer called
       "*grep*" which is viewed in the other window, with one hit per
       line.

       <a name= next-grep-hit>
  <li> After grepping, <b><tt>C-x&nbsp;`</tt></b> (that is, "control-x
       backquote") will step you through the hits, one by one.
       Alternatively, you can click the middle button on a hit to visit
       it.
</ul>

<p><b>Hints:</b>
<ul>
  <li> To continue the example above, if you also want to search your
       <tt>/admin/</tt> tree, you can do:
       <pre>
       grep -n 'room-view' `find . ../admin -name '*.tcl'`
</pre>
       but be sure to keep your backquotes and apostrophes straight.
       (This is just a standard application of the Unix <tt>find</tt>
       command, by the way.)
  <li> <tt>M-x grep</tt> is related to the similar
       <tt>M-x&nbsp;compile</tt> command, which is used to start a
       compilation process in a buffer and then step through the
       compiler errors and warnings one by one.
  <li> Multiple <tt>grep</tt> searches (and/or compilations) can be
       done, as long as one remembers to rename the buffer before
       starting a new search.  To change buffers, go to the
       <tt>grep</tt> or <tt>compile</tt> buffer and visit a hit (either
       by typing <tt>"RET"</tt> or clicking middle on the hit to visit);
       <tt>C-x&nbsp;`</tt> will resume from the next hit in that buffer.
</ul>

<b>Online documentation:</b>
<ul>
  <li> The <b>GNU Emacs manual</b> is available within emacs by typing
       <tt>C-h&nbsp;i</tt> to get to the <tt>info</tt> browser top
       level, and then <tt>"m&nbsp;emacs&nbsp;RET"</tt> within
       <tt>info</tt> to go to the emacs manual pages.  The same material
       is also available online from several source, e.g. <a
       href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/cgi-bin/info2www?(emacs)">
       <tt>www.cs.cmu.edu</tt></a> (describes emacs version 19.22) and,

       has an online version of <a
       href="http://www.fsf.org/software/emacs/emacs-paper.html">"EMACS:
       The Extensible, Customizable Display Editor"</a>, Richard
       Stallman's paper that describes the design of the original emacs,
       i.e. how emacs came to be the way that it is.  This paper was
       written circa 1980, but despite its age, the general information
       it contains is still very much up to date, since emacs has
       remained true to its roots.  (Implementation details are another
       story.)

  <li> The O'Reilly <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/gnu2/">
       <b>Learning GNU Emacs</b> book</a> covers emacs version 19.34 (I
       think), which should be good enough for basic editing, and then
       some.  The advanced sections are sometimes superficial, but the
       basics seem sound.  The companion O'Reilly <a
       href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/gnupr/">GNU Emacs Pocket
       Reference</a> has been updated for version 20.
