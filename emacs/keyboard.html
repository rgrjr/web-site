<h2>Keyboard issues</h2>

<p><a href="/"><tt>Home</tt></a> : <a href="">Emacs tips</a> : Keyboard
<hr>

<p>If you plan on using emacs extensively in the future, you should put
some time into learning to touch-type emacs.  There are several
important advantages:
<ol>
  <li> Using the keyboard effectively will improve your productivity
       greatly.
  <li> Not using the keyboard awkwardly will help avoid hurting your
       hands. 
</ol>
By "touch-type emacs," I mean being able to type commands without
looking at the keyboard by using the fingers of the appropriate hand to
type the character, and those of the other hand (preferably the stronger
index and middle fingers) for the "Control" and "Meta" shifts.

<h3>Recommended keyboard reconfiguration</h3>

<p>In order to touch-type emacs commands, it is necessary to configure
your keyboard with a "Control" modifier key and a "Meta" modifier key on
<strong>each</strong> side of the keyboard.  Such things as
<tt>C-M-t</tt> are just plain awkward to type if you have to use the
same hand for the "Control" and the "T" keys.  If you get into the habit
of typing control/meta modifiers with the opposite hand from the
character key, you will be able to rip out those commands faster with
less wear and tear on your hands.

<p><strong>Carpal tunnel syndrome is not conducive to
productivity,</strong> and I suspect that the contortions that are
otherwise necessary to type arcane key combinations are a factor.  Some
people mistakenly blame these contortions on emacs, when the problem is
really due to brain-dead keyboard layouts; some hardware manufacturers
must assume that you will hardly ever want to type modifier keys.  Many
old Hewlett-Packard keyboards had a single tiny "Ctrl" key at the
extreme upper-left of the main key layout; furthermore, of all the keys,
"Ctrl" was the only one that was hardwired and therefore incapable of
being moved by software to a reasonable location.

<p>Fortunately, despite being made for computers with operating systems
that are more mouse- than keyboard-oriented, most recent keyboards
include a selection of modifier keys, symmetrically placed around the
space bar.  Unfortunately, both Mac and PC systems put the "Control"
keys at the extreme ends of the row, which is hard on the pinkies.  It
is much easier to type modifier keys with the index and middle fingers,
and much faster to do so if these keys are near the space bar.
Consequently, even "modern" keyboards usually need reprogramming to work
well with emacs.

<p>My emacs-friendly keyboard-reprogramming scripts for X11 under Unix
are described below.  As for non-Unix machines, or X11 running under
Windows, you'll need to check the window system documentation.

<a name=keyboard-x11>
<h3>X11 Keyboard reprogramming with <tt>xmodmap</tt></h3>

<p>If you are using <a href="http://www.x.org/">X11</a> on a Unix
machine, the way to do this is with the <tt>xmodmap</tt> command.  I use
<pre>
    xmodmap <a href="sun4u.xmodmaprc">sun4u.xmodmaprc</a>
</pre>
for Sparcstations, and
<pre>
    xmodmap <a href="i586.xmodmaprc">i586.xmodmaprc</a>
</pre>
for my PC; the naming convention allows my <tt>.xinitrc</tt> script to
recognize which is appropriate.  Both versions tell <tt>xmodmap</tt> to
change the keyboard layout to roughly the same configuration (allowing
for different key sizes) that makes it easy to touch-type emacs.  (I
picked this configuration to resemble the Lisp Machine keyboards of my
youth, which is why the "Control" keys are closest to the space bar and
the "Meta" keys just outside of "Control".  If this annoys you, or you
would rather have something more consistent with PC usage, you can
always swap "Control" and "Meta" in the
<tt>"keycode&nbsp;<i>xx</i>&nbsp;="</tt> assignments.)

<p>If you'd rather not mess with the <tt>xmodmap</tt> program directly,
you can use Jamie Zawinski's <a href="http://www.jwz.org/xkeycaps/">
<tt>xkeycaps</tt> program</a>, which provides a Mac-like interface for
finding out and changing keyboard configuration information.  See also
<a href="http://www.jwz.org/xkeycaps/man.html">the <tt>xkeycaps</tt>
<tt>man</tt> page</a>, which summarizes how X11 handles keyboards.

<a name = super-key>
<h3>The "Super-" shift</h3>

<p>Use of the "Super-" shift is optional.  If you like, you can bind
keys to "Super-" shifts in emacs by using something like
<pre>
    (global-set-key [?\s-b] 'beginning-of-line)
</pre>
But I hardly ever take advantage of this, mostly because these shifts
are inconvenient to type.  However, even if you have no use for these
keys, it still pays to leave them as "Super-" shifts, since this
effectively disables the unused keys that send "Super-".  Nothing is
bound to Super-<i>anything</i> in emacs by default, so if you type
<tt>"s-x"</tt> (Super-x) when you meant <tt>"M-x"</tt>, emacs will just
beep; if you had set the key to generate nothing, it would have inserted
an <tt>"x"</tt> (or worse).

<a name = sun-xmodmap>
<h3><tt>xmodmap</tt> and Sun keyboards</h3>

<p>Specifically, <a href="sun4u.xmodmaprc">sun4u.xmodmaprc</a> makes the
the following changes to the default key interpretations on
Sparcstations:
<ul>
  <li> disables the original "Control" key;
  <li> moves the "Meta" modifier keys to the "Alt" key on the left and
       the "Compose" key on the right;
  <li> moves "Control" to the diamond keys next to the space bar (the
       original "Meta" keys); and
  <li> turns the "Caps Lock" and "Alt Graph" keys into "Super-".
</ul>
I have used this on Sparcs for which <tt>uname&nbsp;-m</tt> returns
<tt>"sun4u"</tt> or <tt>"sun4m"</tt>; use with caution on older Sparc
keyboards.  <b>Do not use this</b> on non-Sparc machines; it will
probably screw up your keyboard, since the keycodes will almost
certainly be different.

<p>If you want a more PC-compatible configuration, you can leave "Meta"
where it is and put "Control" on "Caps Lock" and "Alt Graph".  You will
then be typing <tt>"M-"</tt> with your index fingers, and
<tt>"C-"</tt> with your middle fingers.

<a name = pc-xmodmap>
<h3><tt>xmodmap</tt> and PC keyboards</h3>

<p>The <a href="i586.xmodmaprc">i586.xmodmaprc</a> file makes the
following changes to the default key interpretations for <a
href="http://www.xfree86.org/">XFree86</a> on my GNU/Linux PC:
<ul>
  <li> turns the left Alt key and the "flag" key (just right of the
       right Alt) into "Control-",
  <li> turns the "flag" key (left of the left Alt) and the right "menu"
       key into "Meta-",
  <li> turns the left Ctrl and right Ctrl keys into "Super-", and
  <li> optionally disables "Caps Lock".
</ul>

<p>Graphically, the bottom row of the keyboard changes from this:
<pre>
    +-----++----++----++---------------------------++----++----++----++-----+
    |Ctrl ||Flag||Alt ||         Space bar         ||Alt ||Flag||Menu||Ctrl |
    +-----++----++----++---------------------------++----++----++----++-----+
</pre>
to this:
<pre>
    +-----++----++----++---------------------------++----++----++----++-----+
    |Super||Meta||Ctrl||         Space bar         ||&lt;no&gt;||Ctrl||Meta||Super|
    +-----++----++----++---------------------------++----++----++----++-----+
</pre>

<p>This is inconsistent from right to left, but it more accurately
echoes the physical arrangement I have set up on the Sun Sparcstation
keyboards at work.  Please read the comments in the file before you
attempt to use it.  <b>Do not use this</b> on non-PCs; it will probably
screw up your keyboard, since the keycodes will almost certainly be
different.

<a name = suggestion>
<h3>An extreme suggestion</h3>

If I were willing to reprogram my brain (again) in order to take
advantage of a more emacs-optimal keyboard layout, I'd probably do a few
things differently.  In particular, I'd keep the "Meta-" keys next to
the space bar, so that people with no Lisp Machine experience don't
freak out when the try to type on my keyboard.  Better still, since it
is most efficient to avoid switching hands during command sequences that
bounce back and forth from one side of the keyboard to the other (how
fast can <i>you</i> type <tt>"C-p C-a C-o C-b"</tt>), I might try using
the "Super-" shift to overload the left half of the keyboard.  In other
words,
<ul>
  <li> <tt>"s-g"</tt> would map to <tt>"h"</tt>, 
  <li> <tt>"C-s-g"</tt> would map to <tt>"C-h"</tt>, 
  <li> <tt>"C-M-s-g"</tt> would map to <tt>"C-M-h"</tt>,
  <li> <tt>"s-f"</tt> would map to <tt>"j"</tt>, 
  <li> <tt>"C-s-f"</tt> would map to <tt>"C-j"</tt>, 
  <li> etc.
</ul>
That way, I could type long command sequences with the left hand in
standard position, and the three longest fingers of the right hand
providing all of the modifier shifts.  I would only ever have to move my
right hand, and only to type long sequences of text.

<p>Then again, if I were willing to reprogram my brain at all, I'd be
better off switching to an ergonomic split-keyboard design that puts the
modifiers in the middle where they can be worked with the thumbs without
ever needing to move your hands.
