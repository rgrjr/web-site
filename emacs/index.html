<p>This page of <b>emacs usage tips</b> was originally written for my
fellow <a href="http://photo.net/teaching/boot-camp.html">ArsDigita
Web/DB bootcampers</a>.  The current version includes stuff incorporated
from an earlier set of help pages written for my colleagues at <a
href="http://bmerc-www.bu.edu/">BMERC</a>.

<p>[<b>Note:</b> I am in the process of reorganizing this, so some of
the links may be broken.  Please bear with me.  -- rgr, 27-May-00.]

<h2>Notation conventions</h2>

I use an HTML-ized version of the standard emacs notation:
<ul>
  <li> <tt>find-file</tt> is the name of an emacs lisp function (the same 
       style is used for variables);
  <li> <tt>C-x C-f</tt> denotes the standard key sequence that invokes 
       <tt>find-file</tt>, but
  <li> <tt>M-x find-file</tt> also works to invoke this command.
  <li> <tt>"C-x C-f foo TAB bar TAB RET"</tt> denotes a specific
       sequence of characters that invokes one or more commands,
       possibly with arguments.  The spaces in this string are just for
       readability and are not to be typed; if a space character is
       required, it will be written <tt>SPC</tt>.  This example uses 11
       characters (C-x, C-f, f, o, o, TAB, b, a, r, TAB, and RET); the
       enclosing quotes don't count.
  <li> In a defining list of commands,
       <ul>
	 <li> <b><tt>C-x&nbsp;C-f</tt></b> (<tt>find-file</tt>)
       </ul>
       shows both the standard key sequence, and the command it invokes
       in parentheses, followed by a description of what it does.  Since
       different editing modes can use the same key sequence for
       different commands, it is unambiguous to include both.  (But
       command names are usually omitted for keys that are rarely
       rebound.)
</ul>

<h2>Learning emacs</h2>

The ideal way to learn emacs, really the only way, is to sit down in
front of it and bang away.  If you have access to emacs, then you have
several options:
<ul>
  <li> Use the built-in emacs tutorial.  Simply start emacs and type
       <tt>C-h&nbsp;t</tt>; follow instructions from there.
  <li> Look through the "Other resources" pages below, bring your
       favorite up in a browser next to emacs, and experiment.
  <li> Or, get one of the <a href="advanced.html#oreilly">O'Reilly emacs
       offerings</a> mentioned below, and start playing.
</ul>
In your experimentation, be sure to edit source code in Tcl, or a
language you know.

<p>If you don't have access to emacs, then your options are much more
limited.  I emphatically don't recommend trying to learn emacs solely
from a book; you'll only put yourself to sleep.  If you can't <a
href="ftp://prep.ai.mit.edu/pub/gnu/emacs/">download and install it</a>
yourself on your machine, then you're best off glancing at, say, the <a
href="http://www.tc.cornell.edu/Edu/Tutor/Basics/emacs/emacsis.great">
<tt>emacsis.great</tt> tutorial page</a>, and otherwise waiting until
you can get your hands on a keyboard.

<p><b>Cheat sheets and other short summaries:</b>
<ul>
  <li> <a href="http://www.primenet.com/~cohen/emacs_cheat.html"> Dave
       Cohen's emacs cheat sheet</a>, written by an alumnus of the
       August 1999 bootcamp.
  <li> Also, <a href="emacs_cheat.html">Bob Rogers' extended version</a>
       of Dave Cohen's emacs cheat sheet.
  <li> <a href="tutorial.html">Tutorial outline</a> for the tutorial
       presented at bootcamp on 4-Oct-99.
  <li> <a href="http://www.refcards.com/about/emacs.html">
       <tt>www.refcards.org</tt></a> has an information-rich emacs
       reference card (which doesn't seem to want to print on printers
       of vintage 1995 or earlier).
</ul>

<p><b>Tutorials and other longer articles:</b>
<ul>
  <li> The Linux <a
       href="http://www.linuxdoc.org/HOWTO/Emacs-Beginner-HOWTO.html">Emacs
       Beginner's HOWTO</a> by Jeremy D. Zawodny gives a good overview
       of emacs that is not specific to Linux.  It is available from <a
       href="http://www.wcnet.org/jzawodn/emacs/">
       <tt>http://www.wcnet.org/jzawodn/emacs/</tt></a> as well as from
       <a
       href="http://www.linuxdoc.org/HOWTO/Emacs-Beginner-HOWTO.html">
       <tt>http://www.linuxdoc.org/HOWTO/Emacs-Beginner-HOWTO.html</tt></a>.
  <li> <a
       href="http://www.tc.cornell.edu/Edu/Tutor/Basics/emacs/emacsis.great">
       <tt>emacsis.great</tt> tutorial page</a> (not hypertext), with a
       topical command summary at the bottom.  This is very dense, and
       covers a lot of ground.
  <li> <a href="http://www.faqs.org/faqs/GNU-Emacs-FAQ/">GNU emacs
       FAQ</a>.  This is also available in emacs itself by typing
       <tt>"C-h&nbsp;F"</tt> (note that the "F" must be capitalized).
       The Web version is hypertext, though it isn't very easy to
       navigate, and it does have a <a
       href="http://www.faqs.org/faqs/GNU-Emacs-FAQ/reference-pointer/">
       reference page</a> that points to all kinds of good stuff.  The
       version within emacs is not hypertext, but it's all on one page,
       and you can use <tt>C-s</tt> (incremental search) to find things
       of interest.
</ul>
