<p>So far, we have only looked at language features that leave one
context forever, returning to an earlier context that is still in
progress (which does what is called <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_stack#Unwinding"> stack
unwinding</a>).  But continuations can also take us in the other
direction, and even back and forth.

<blockquote>
The continuation that obeys only obvious stack semantics,
O grasshopper, is not the true continuation.<br>
<i>-- Guy Steele, as quoted by <a
href="http://paulgraham.com/quotes.html">Paul Graham</a></i>
</blockquote>

<p>This can be desirable when we must interleave multiple computations
with complex state (and can't use threading).  For example:

<ul>
  <li> Hardware simulation (and other "interacting black box"
       scenarios).
  <li> Simulation of background jobs in non-threaded code.
  <li> Parallel traversal.
</ul>

<p>An example of the last case is the "same fringe" problem, the object
of which is to test whether two trees have the same leaves under some
traversal order, i.e. <b>regardless of internal structure</b>.

<p>Suppose we wanted to suspend and then resume our enumeration of
