<h3>PIR is "Parrot Intermediate Representation"</h3>

<ul>
  <li> PIR is a (higher-level) assembly language for Parrot.
  <li> Parrot is a register machine, with four register types:  integer,
       numeric (float), string, and "PMC" (object).
  <li> The number of registers is effectively unlimited; each sub gets
       however many it needs.  Registers can be declared explicitly, or
       implicitly (by naming them <tt>$P32</tt>, for example).
  <li> Each PIR line is nominally a single instruction.
  <li> Parrot instructions take zero or more registers as operands
       (there are no stacks), though not all instructions are
       implemented for all register types.
  <li> Simple control structure are implemented via conditional
       branching, i.e. <tt>"if <i>condition</i> goto <i>label</i>"</tt>.
  <li> Subs are defined in PIR between <tt>.sub</tt> and <tt>.end</tt>
       directives.
  <li> All sub argument values and results are passed explicitly, with
       built-in arg checking.
</ul>

<h3>Parrot's runtime data structures</h3>

Parrot needs data structures to represent its internal execution state.
Most of these can be manipulated as PMC ("Parrot Magic Cookie") objects.

<ul>
  <li> Each thread is represented by an <tt>Interpreter</tt>.
  <li> A <tt>Parrot_Context</tt> holds the ephemeral state of a given
       invocation of a sub (but is not a PMC).  This is usually called
       an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_stack#Structure">
       "activation record" or "stack frame"</a> in the literature.
  <li> There are three general kinds of function-like object:
       <ol>
	 <li> Subroutines in source code create <tt>Sub</tt> objects
	      when compiled and loaded.
	 <li> The <tt>newclosure</tt> instruction takes a <tt>Sub</tt>
	      and returns a <tt>Closure</tt> that refers to the current
	      sub's context.
	 <li> A <tt>Continuation</tt> returns to a previously-created
	      context, rather than creating a new one.  (An error
	      handler is a subclass of <tt>Continuation</tt>.)
       </ol>
       All of these objects can be called via the <tt>invoke</tt>
       instruction and its cousins.
</ul>
