<h1>Introduction</h1>

<a href="../">Advanced control structures</a> : Introduction
<hr>

<p>We all know about "for" and "while" loops -- they are implemented
with gotos -- but what really happens when you "goto" a label that is
outside the sub?  How does error handling work under the hood?  What's a
coroutine good for, and how does it work?

<p>The answers to all of these questions involve something called a
"continuation," which is just a generalized goto.  Ordinary gotos
transfer control to another location within the same call to the same
subroutine.  Continuations can also jump to a <b>different</b>
subroutine invocation, and can pass values just like a sub call.  This
makes them essential for implementing nonlocal transfer of control.

<p>Here's what I will be discussing:

<ul>
  <li> Basic Parrot assembly code, and the runtime data structures that
       support bytecode execution.
  <li> Function calling as a control structure (e.g. <tt>map</tt> in
       Perl 5).
  <li> How to implement various sorts of nonlocal exits using Parrot
       continuations.
  <li> How error handling is implemented in terms of continuations.
  <li> Coroutines impose a thread-like structure on continuation
       calling.
</ul>

<p>Here's what I will <b>not</b> be talking about:

<ul>
  <li> CP-transformation (another view of continuations).
  <li> Backtracking (see the 28th test case in <a
       href="https://svn.perl.org/parrot/trunk/t/op/lexicals.t">
       <tt>t/op/lexicals.t</tt></a> for an example).
</ul>
