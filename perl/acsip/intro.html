<h1>So, what is an "advanced" control structure anyway?</h1>

<p><a href="/"><tt>Home</tt></a> : <a href="/perl/">Perl/Parrot</a> :
<a href="index.html">Advanced control structures</a> : Introduction
<hr>

<p>We all know that a control structure is a way of changing the
sequence of program actions.  Simple control structures are implemented
using <tt>goto</tt>, which jumps somewhere else in the same sub
invocation.  Advanced control structures involve jumps <b>between</b>
subs.  This includes such things as language constructs for exception
handling.  Dynamic languages support at least some of these features,
which are also known collectively as nonlocal control transfers.

<p>Here's what I will be covering:

<ul>
  <li> Basic Parrot assembly code, and the runtime data structures that
       support bytecode execution.
  <li> Function calling as a control structure (e.g. <tt>map</tt> in
       Perl 5).
  <li> How to implement various sorts of nonlocal control transfers
       using Parrot continuations, with working sample code.
  <li> How error handling is implemented in terms of continuations.
  <li> How coroutines provide a thread-like interface to continuation
       calling.
</ul>

<p>You might be interested in this because:

<ul>
  <li> You are writing a compiler for a language that needs these
       features; or
  <li> You write in a dynamic language, and want to know how this stuff
       works under the hood.
</ul>

<p>Here's what I will <b>not</b> be talking about:

<ul>
  <li> <a
       href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuation_passing_style">
       Continuation-passing style</a> and CP-transformation (another
       view of continuations).
  <li> Backtracking (see the 28th test case in <a
       href="https://svn.perl.org/parrot/trunk/t/op/lexicals.t">
       <tt>t/op/lexicals.t</tt></a> for an example).
</ul>
