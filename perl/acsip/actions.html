<p>What if we needed to modify the dynamic environment in which the tree
traversal operated?  In Lisp, we can change how numbers are printed by
binding <tt>*print-base*</tt> to something different around the
<tt>map-elts</tt> call.  Consider the following one-line change to the
previous example:

<pre class="example">
(defun find-if-greater (tree limit)
  <b>(let ((*print-base* 2))</b>
    (map-elts tree #'(lambda (value)
		       (when (&gt; value limit)
			 (format t "Found ~S~%" value)
			 (return-from find-if-greater value))))
    "nothing"<b>)</b>)
</pre>
<a href="map-elts-return.lisp">[view full source]</a>

<p>This causes the "Found" values to be output in binary, because the
new value of <tt>*print-base*</tt> is visible globally and dynamically,
and hence affects the operation of the number printer, but everything
else remains in decimal, because the other printing is outside of its
dynamic scope.

<pre class="output">
CL-USER&gt; <b>(load "map-elts-binary.lisp")</b>
Found 111
Returned 7 for 6.
Found 1001
Returned 9 for 8.
Returned nothing for 99.
CL-USER&gt;
</pre>

<p>It's kinda like <tt>local</tt> in Perl 5:
<pre class="example">
sub find_if_greater {
    my ($tree, $limit) = @_;

    my $result;
    local $print_base = 2;
    map_elts($tree, sub { ... });
    $result = "nothing";
  done:
    return $result;
}
</pre>
<a href="map-elts-binary.pl.text">[view full source]</a>

<p>The straightforward way to implement this in Parrot would be to save
the old value in a register, store the new value, and then set it back
again at the end of the scope.  That doesn't work when calling a
continuation bypasses the cleanup code.  What we need is a general
facility that ensures the cleanup code is always executed, no matter how
the scope is exited.  Perl 6 uses <tt>LEAVE</tt> blocks (or
<tt>KEEP</tt> or <tt>UNDO</tt>).  Perl 5 doesn't support this (except
indirectly by catching errors).  Common Lisp uses
<tt>unwind-protect</tt>, so we can rewrite the modified
<tt>find-if-greater</tt> as follows:

<pre class="example">
(defun find-if-greater (tree limit)
  (let ((old-print-base *print-base*))
    (unwind-protect
	 (progn (setq *print-base* 2)
		(map-elts tree #'(lambda (value) ...))
		"nothing")
      (setq *print-base* old-print-base))))
</pre>

<p>To fulfill this need, Parrot provides <tt>pushaction</tt>, which adds
the sub or closure that does the cleanup to environment in a way that is
visible to and respected by continuations.  To use it, we must add the
following to <tt>find_if_greater</tt>:

<pre class="example">
.sub find_if_greater
        ...

	## Save off the old *PRINT-BASE* value.
	.local pmc old_print_base, new_print_base
	.lex 'old_print_base', old_print_base
	old_print_base = get_hll_global '*PRINT-BASE*'

	## Define an action to restore it.
	.local pmc restore_sub, restore_closure
	.const .Sub restore_sub = '_restore_old_print_base'
	restore_closure = newclosure restore_sub
	pushaction restore_closure

	## Set *PRINT-BASE* to 2.
	new_print_base = new 'Integer'
	new_print_base = 2
	set_hll_global '*PRINT-BASE*', new_print_base

	...
</pre>
<a href="map-elts-binary.pir">[view full source]</a>

<p>The cleanup action is straightforward:

<pre class="example">
.sub _restore_old_print_base :outer('find_if_greater')
	.local pmc old_print_base
	old_print_base = find_lex 'old_print_base'
	set_hll_global '*PRINT-BASE*', old_print_base
.end
</pre>
<a href="map-elts-binary.pir">[view full source]</a>

<p>The only other changes to the source that are needed are ones to
initialize the <tt>*print-base*</tt> global, and to implement
<tt>*print-base*</tt>-aware printing (not shown).

<p>Parrot saves the action in a linked list called the dynamic
environment, which also (currently) contains active error handlers.  The
program starts with an empty dynamic environment, which is represented
explicitly with a "root" list element:

<p><img src="action-1.png">
<a href="action-1.svg">[before pushing the action]</a>

<p>Note that the interpreter and the return continuation from
<tt>find_if_greater</tt> both point to the initial element.

<p>When we invoke <tt>pushaction</tt>, the interpreter points to a new
dynamic environment element:

<p><img src="action-2.png">
<a href="action-2.svg">[after pushing the action]</a>

<p>This is still in effect before the exit continuation is called:

<p><img src="action-3.png">
<a href="action-3.svg">[before calling the continuation]</a>

<p>When the exit continuation is called, the interpreter notices that
the dynamic environment is being restored to a previous state, and runs
the action.

<h3>What is a continuation, really?</h3>

We are now in a position to define Parrot continuations precisely:

<blockquote>
A continuation is an object that captures the following state:
<ul>
  <li> An executing context;
  <li> An instruction in that context's sub; and
  <li> The dynamic environment at the point of capture.
</ul>
All of this state is restored when the continuation is invoked, resuming
execution with the specified instruction.
</blockquote>

<p>This has a few consequences worth noting:

<ol>
  <li> A continuation can only return to some place you've already been,
       and only if you bothered to create a continuation and store it
       someplace useful.
  <li> The <tt>set_addr</tt> instruction that initializes ("takes") the
       continuation must be in the same sub as the instruction it
       targets.
  <li> The captured dynamic environment is always that of the
       <tt>set_addr</tt> instruction, so the PIR author (compiler or
       human) must be careful that this environment "makes sense" for
       the target instruction.
  <li> Continuations do not capture variable values, so continuation
       calling does not affect them.  (That would be travelling in time,
       rather than space.)
  <li> A continuation may be invoked only in the interpreter that
       created it.
</ol>
