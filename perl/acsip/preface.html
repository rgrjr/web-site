<p>We all know about "for" and "while" loops -- they are implemented
with gotos -- but what really happens when you "goto" a label that is
outside the sub?  How does error handling work under the hood?  What's a
coroutine good for, and how does it work?

<p>The answers to all of these questions involve something called a
"continuation," which is just a generalized goto.  Ordinary gotos
transfer control to another location within the same call to the same
subroutine.  Continuations can also jump to a <b>different</b>
subroutine invocation, and can pass values just like a sub call.  This
makes them essential for implementing nonlocal transfer of control.
