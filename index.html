<h1>Bob Rogers:  The Web Site</h1>

Also known as "Robert G. Rogers Jr," hence the <tt>"rgrjr"</tt> in the
domain names I use.  I live in the town of Arlington, Massachusetts, and
do Lisp programming, bioinformatics, computer networking, and GNU/Linux,
in no special order.  I often get phone calls for "Bob Rogers the soccer
coach" -- that's not me.

<p>Now that you've presumably decided I'm the right "Bob Rogers" (there
must be thousands of us), welcome to my Web site.

<p><i>[Note:  I'm currently in the process of "spring cleaning" for my
Web site, updating the content and streamlining the organization.  Pages
that I have started to update have the same aqua background as this page
(the "2004 look" for my Web site).  Pages with a white background are
2000-2003 material that I haven't yet touched.  I plan to start with the
<a href="hits.html">most popular pages</a>, but the process may take a
while.  -- rgr, 25-Apr-04.]</i>
