<h1>Bob Rogers:  The Web Site</h1>

Also known as "Robert G. Rogers Jr," hence the <tt>"rgrjr"</tt> in the
domain names I use.  I live and work in Arlington, Massachusetts, and do
Lisp programming, bioinformatics, computer networking, and GNU/Linux, in
no special order.  I often get phone calls for "Bob Rogers the soccer
coach" -- that's not me.

<p>Now that you've presumably decided I'm the right "Bob Rogers" (there
must be thousands of us), welcome to my Web site.

<ul>
  <li> My <a href="bob/">personal directory</a>, including my <a
       href="/bob/resume.html"> resume</a>.
  <li> <a href="/icancad/">ICanCAD</a>, an Open Source CAD system for
       analog and mixed-signal integrated circuits (or it will be when
       I'm a little further along in writing it).
  <li> <a href="/emacs/">emacs help pages</a> (the original version of
       which is still available at <a
       href="http://bmerc-www.bu.edu/needle-doc/emacs/">BMERC</a>).
  <li> <a href="/climbing/">Climbing resources</a> for the Boston area.
  <li> <a href="/linux/">Linux information</a>, based on my experience
       of bringing up various services on this machine.
  <li> <a href="hits.html">Summary of popular pages on this site.</a>
  <li> <a href="visitors.html">Site visitors</a>.  Out of curiousity, I
       started looking at what software (browser and OS) people use to
       visit my Web site.
</ul>

<h2>My other links</h2>

Some of this may eventually be mirrored or rehosted here.

<ul>
  <li> <a href="http://bmerc-www.bu.edu/needle-doc/"><tt>needle</tt>
       tools software</a> for protein structure database manipulation
       and extraction of statistics.
  <li> <a href="http://bmerc-www.bu.edu/needle-doc/netatalk.html">
       "Accessing Unix files from the Mac"</a>, a page I wrote for <a
       href="http://thehamptons.com/anders/netatalk/">
       <tt>netatalk</tt></a> users at BMERC who are Unix-literate
       (i.e. they use Unix to run programs, rather than just to serve
       files).
</ul>
