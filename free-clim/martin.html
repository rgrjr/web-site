My somewhat conservative bro. (where he gets it I don't know) is ready
to say we have the plans in place that will bring in some dollars and so
we are pleased to offer you another crack at the port to the PC!
<p>Seriously, we now now closing on an arrangement that will allow us to
proceed.
<p>So Bob, can you spare some more time? By the hour for say a month or
two then we can offer a full time position all being well....
<p>A couple of things have happened since last time: Franz now have 6.0
beta out and we may want to look at that. Quite what 6.0 buys for us I
am not sure - I expect a major release (5 to 6) will have some fundamental
changes and we can maybe exploit them. Can you browse the Franz site and
check with Laura to see what impact it may have on our plans? I am wondering
whether to ask you to try to do it on Common Graphics rather than CLIM.
I say this because I have a lot of stuff now on CG and I have a number
presentation system hacks that work well as well as a dynamic dialog box
thing that does some cool stuff e.g.:
<p>(let ((a 44)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (b "fred")
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (c red))
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (in-dialog-box ()
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (dsetf a :integer :prompt "A number")
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (dsetf b :string :prompt "A string")
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (dsetf c :color :prompt "Color")))
<p><img SRC="C:TEMPnsmailD3.jpeg" height=166 width=364>
<p>And more hacks that can make it look very nice like:
<br>(let ((a 44)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (b "fred")
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (c red)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (d :lisp))
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (in-dialog-box (:name "Ive been hacking" :additional-choices-alignment
:h)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (dialog-row ()
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (dialog-column (:name "Two
things")
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (dsetf a :integer
:prompt "A number" :direction :h)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (dsetf b :string
:prompt "A string" :direction :h))
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (dsetf d :alist :choices
'(:lisp :java) :direction :v :prompt "What?"))
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (dsetf c :color :prompt "Color")))
<p><img SRC="C:TEMPnsmail4B.jpeg" height=142 width=463>
<p>Its quite powerful: here is one generated at run time by this plotter
(below)
<br><img SRC="C:TEMPnsmailSS.jpeg" height=488 width=573>
<p>And wicked cool plotters like this: (any ADI stock?)
<p><img SRC="C:TEMPnsmailOQ.jpeg" height=470 width=733>
<p>The frame has a mouse doc line, context sensitive mouse tracking, defined
gestures, etc, all the good stuff but not quite up to Symbolics standards....
<p>Anyhow, enough showing off - I don't have schematic entry system....
If I can do this while I am supposed to be working on electronic designs
I know you can do even better.
<p>So would you consider reviewing common graphics? My hope is that CG
may work on Unix and Linux one day too. Another reason, quite frankly,&nbsp;
is that we are hiring Dave England ex Intel corp. and he has persuaded
me that we we can get all the tools on Windows. That is, besides the schematic
if you can do it we can get Verilog, Layout, SPICE (I have this) and logic
simulators. I realize you would be back to almost square one but please
take a look anyhow....
<p>I have Rel 6 beta but haven't tried anything yet. Laura will be able
to get you a password to get it if you want....
<p>Let me know Bob....
<p>Martin M.
<br>PS forgot your "real" Email so blasted them all..</html>
