<h2>Security alerts</h2>

href="/linux/security/">Security</a> : Alerts
<hr>

<p>Every now and then, when I learn of some severe security problem that
impacts a large number of computer users, I decide to send email to
alert my friends and acquaintances.  On a somewhat more frequent basis,
I send alerts concerning server security problems to a group of fellow
Linux users.  I have started collecting these online, for the record,
and for easy reference.

<p>None of these are original discoveries, but are summaries of security
advisories posted elsewhere, usually on bugtraq.  The alerts in the
first batch are of general interest, and are aimed at the non-expert.
Those in the second batch are focused toward Linux users who run
servers, but are usually also of interest to Unix sysadmins generally.

<h3>Alerts of interest to people running clients</h3>

This means you!

<p>Note that most of these also affect Windows users; they are filed
under <tt>"/linux/security/"</tt> for historical reasons.

<dl>
  <dt> <a href="msie-ssl-flash.text"><b>"Some excellent reasons to ditch
       Internet Explorer, Flash"</b></a> (14 Aug 2002)
  <dd> Omnibus alert that discusses (1) a severe SSL cert-checking
       vulnerability in MSIE and Konqueror (sometime referred to as
       "certificate chain spoofing"), (2) the random unpatched IE
       vulnerabilities listed at <a
       href="http://www.pivx.com/larholm/unpatched/">
       <tt>http://www.pivx.com/larholm/unpatched/</tt></a>, (3) an
       exploitable Shockwave Flash buffer overrun, and (4) the new
       licensing terms for Windows Update and Automatic Update that one
       must accept to get Windows 2000 SP3.  On 2&nbsp;September, it was
       revealed that Outlook is also affected.
  <dt> <a href="msie-download-1.text"><b>"MSIE download dialog may lie
       about file type</b></a> (26 Nov 2001)
  <dt> <a href="msie-download-1.text"><b>"Followup to: MSIE download
       dialog may lie about file type</b></a> (16 Dec 2001)
  <dd> Excerpts two advisories about MSIE problems that allow Web sites
       to run arbitrary programs on a user's computer with inadequate or
       no warning.  Microsoft has said that they do not consider this a
       problem.
  <dt> <a href="csrf.text"><b>"New HTML vuln: Cross-Site Request
       Forgeries (CSRF)"</b></a> (16 Jun 2001)
  <dd> [describe.  -- rgr, 14-Aug-02.]
</dl>

<h3>Alerts of interest to people running servers</h3>

<dl>
  <dt> <a href="ssh-trojan.text"><b>"Trojaned OpenSSH on OpenBSD
       server"</b></a> (1 Aug 2002)
  <dd> This is no longer relevant; somebody managed to slip a trojan
       into the OpenSSH tarfile, but it was detected quickly.  I posted
       this in case somebody downloaded a fresh copy to rebuild after
       updating OpenSSL.
  <dt> <a href="ssl-1.text"><b>"Multiple OpenSSL problems"</b></a> (30
       Jul 2002)
  <dd> Multiple remotely exploitable vulnerabilities in OpenSSL
       pre-0.9.6d; used by OpenSSH, among others.
  <dt> <a href="openssh-2.text"><b>"[Theo de Raadt: Upcoming
       OpenSSH vulnerability]"</b></a> (26 Jun 2002)
  <dt> <a href="openssh-2-followup.text"><b>"[Theo de Raadt: Upcoming
       OpenSSH vulnerability]"</b></a> (followup; 26 Jun 2002)
  <dd> Remotely exploitable vulnerabilities in OpenSSH pre-3.3.1.
  <dt> <a href="code-red.text"><b>"'Code Red' worm"</b></a> (20 Jul
       2001)
  <dd> Informational message about the original "Code Red" worm, which
       affects Microsoft IIS Web servers.  Note that "Code Red II,"
       which came to light a few months later, is much more severe.  A
       year after CRII, I <i>still</i> see hits from these worms in my
       Web logs, indicating unpatched servers.
  <dt> <a href="linux-kernel-cap.text"><b> "Serious Linux kernel flaw;
       upgrade now!"</b></a> (5 Jul 2000)
  <dd> Conceptual bug in Linux "capabilities" that makes <tt>setuid</tt>
       programs readily exploitable.  (Affects all Linux users, but is a
       local exploit, so requires shell access -- or an exploitable
       server bug.)
