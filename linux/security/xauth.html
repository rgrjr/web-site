<h3>Introduction</h3>

This page describes a series of recipes I have developed for copying X11
cookies back and forth.  This is part of my security pages for two
reasons:
<ol>
  <li> The more paranoid settings for <a href="ssh.html">SSH (Secure
       Shell)</a> servers frequently make cookie copying necessary in
       order to <tt>su</tt> or roam around the remote LAN by means other
       than further SSH connections.  And SSH servers are getting
       progressively more paranoid.
  <li> Copying cookies usually reduces your security to some degree, and
       might do so drastically if done wrong.  You should be aware of
       the consequences, and willing to accept them (though you should
       <i>not</i> assume that I have understood them all or been able to
       explain them fully; <i>caveat lector</i>).
</ol>

<a name = cookies>
<h4>X11 Authentication</h4>

In order to understand how copying cookies can sometimes weaken the
security of your X11 session, it is necessary to understand what is
meant by "cookie" and how X11 uses them to control access.  First, we
need to cover some general background information on X11 authentication.

<p>The two commonest means of controlling access to an X11 display are
host-based access, and the <tt>MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1</tt> protocol.

<dl>
  <dt> <b>Host-based access.</b>
  <dd> This allows all connections from a given host, i.e. anyone logged
       on to that host can connect to your display.  Since this makes it
       really easy to snoop on on your X11 session.  As long as you did
       not start X11 yourself (via the <tt>startx</tt> or <tt>xinit</tt>
       scripts, or something based on one of those), you are probably
       not using host-based access.  Host-based access does not use
       cookies, and will not be discussed further.
  <dt> <b><tt>MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1</tt></b>
  <dd> This is what <tt>xdm</tt> uses by default.
       [finish.  -- rgr, 14-Sep-01.]
  <dt> <b><tt>XDM-AUTHORIZATION-1</tt>, <tt>SUN-DES-1</tt>, and
       <tt>MIT-KERBEROS-5</tt></b>
  <dd> Depending on the system, other authorization modes may be
       supported.  These three are all more secure in that a snooper
       cannot steal your credentials by listening to the authentication
       dialog, but are more difficult to set up, and are therefore much
       less common.  This is not surprising because, in my opinion,
       using (e.g.) Kerberos authentication on an X11 server is like
       putting a padlock on a tent:  it makes little sense to protect
       the authentication from snooping when any snooper could just as
       easily collect all of your keystrokes from the subsequent
       traffic, including such things as passwords typed in an
       <tt>xterm</tt>.  If that is a potential problem, then you should
       be using SSH to encrypt the entire X11 session, in which case the
       use of <tt>MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1</tt> is quite adequate.
</dl>

<p>[explain how cookies work, <tt>$XAUTHORITY</tt> var,
<tt>~/.Xauthority</tt> file.  -- rgr, 15-Sep-01.]

<a name = xauthority-env-var>
<h4><tt>su</tt> and <tt>$XAUTHORITY</tt></h4>

In any case, once you have done <tt>"su"</tt>, the client user will
inherit the source user's <tt>$XAUTHORITY</tt> value, which is usually
the wrong thing.  If so, you can do something like:
<blockquote>
<pre>
% old_xauth=$XAUTHORITY
% XAUTHORITY=~/.Xauthority
% export XAUTHORITY
%
</pre>
</blockquote>
(in Bourne shell syntax) to rectify this.

<a name = recipes>
<h3>Cookie copying recipes</h3>

<p>In all of these descriptions, the following terminology is used:
<ul>
  <li> The X11 server (or SSH proxy X11 server) runs on
       <tt><i>serverhost</i></tt> under <tt><i>serveruser</i></tt>, with
       a cookie file on <tt><i>cookiehost</i></tt> (which will be owned
       by <tt><i>serveruser</i></tt>, with permissions that allow nobody
       else to read it).
  <li> The X11 client application runs on <tt><i>clienthost</i></tt>
       under <tt><i>clientuser</i></tt>.
</ul>
There are a number of cases depending upon whether the client user is
privileged, and whether NFS or SSH is involved.  The location of the
cookie relative to the client (in terms of both host location and user
ID) turns out to be the critical factor.  Fortunately, the actual
location of the X11 server (or proxy server) is relatively unimportant.

<p>Note that <tt><i>serveruser</i></tt> is usually your initial login on
the machine running the display, but this is not true when the
connection is made via <a href="ssh.html">SSH</a>.  If you have done
<tt>"ssh&nbsp;user@randomhost.foo.com"</tt>, then SSH will start a proxy
server on <tt>randomhost</tt> and set <tt>$DISPLAY</tt> in the shell it
spawns on <tt>randomhost.foo.com</tt> to something like
<tt>"randomhost:10.0"</tt>.  To connect to the proxy, and hence the
original display over the encrypted connection, you will need to use
<tt>user</tt>'s cookie for <tt>"randomhost:10.0"</tt>, so in this case
<tt>user</tt> will be the <tt><i>serveruser</i></tt> and
<tt>randomhost</tt> will be the <tt><i>cookiehost</i></tt>.

<a name = find-recipe>
<h4>Finding the right cookie recipe</h4>

<p>To find a cookie recipe relevant to a given situation, apply the
following algorithm to the table below it:
<ol>
  <li> Starting at the top left corner, run down the column until you
       come to a question where the answer is "Yes."  [I need links to
       help for figuring this out.  -- rgr, 16-Nov-01.]
  <li> Repeat on the questions that appear to the right of the "yes"
       question.
  <li> When you come to a statement, which will be the last thing on the
       row, you are done.  The statement describes your options with
       links to the appropriate recipes.
</ol>

<p>
<table border=2>
  <tr>
    <td rowspan=3>Cookie located on same host as client?  (This may or may not be the
         same as the X11 server host.)</td>
    <td>Client and server user are the same?</td>
    <td colspan=3>Normal case <a href="#normal">[1]</a>.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Client user is root?</td>
    <td colspan=3>Set XAUTHORITY <a href="#local-root">[2]</a>,

    <td>Different non-root client user?</td>
    <td colspan=3>Copy cookie between accounts (same 
         machine) <a href="#unprivileged-local">[5]</a>.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td rowspan=5>Cookie located elsewhere on the LAN?</td>
    <td>Cookie is not exported (e.g. in /tmp/)?</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td rowspan=2>Client user is root?</td>
    <td>"Root squashing" in effect?</td>
    <td>Copy cookie with local "su" <a href="#root-cannot-read">[4]</a>.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>No "root squashing?"</td>
    <td>Set XAUTHORITY <a href="#local-root">[2]</a>,

</table>

<p>[<b>Cool hack alert:</b> The table is above is an HTML representation
of a decision tree, and was generated automatically from <a
href="xauth.tbl">this data file</a> by <a href="dt2html.pl.text">this
Perl script</a>.  -- rgr, 16-Nov-01.]

<a name = normal>
<h4>Same user</h4>

This is the "normal" case; if this doesn't work, something basic is
wrong.
<a name = check-xauthority>
Check the value of <tt>$XAUTHORITY</tt> by typing
<tt>"echo&nbsp;$XAUTHORITY"</tt> at the shell where you tried to start
the client.  If this is undefined (you'll get a blank line or "undefined
variable" message if so) or just plain wrong, try the next recipe.

<p>If an SSH proxy is involved, it may mean that the server doesn't know
where to find the <tt>xauth</tt> binary, and therefore hasn't set up
forwarding.  This is a compile-time issue; ask your sysadmin.

<a name = local-root>
<h4><tt>root</tt> can inherit <tt>$XAUTHORITY</tt>.</h4>

When the client account is <tt>root</tt>, and the cookie file is on a
disk on the machine where the client application is to be run, then life
is easy.  This usually means either
<dl compact>
  <dt> (a)
  <dd> <tt>$DISPLAY</tt> points to an X11 server or SSH2 proxy on the
       client host; or
  <dt> (b)
  <dd> <tt>$DISPLAY</tt> was started with <tt>xdm</tt>, and the client
       host holds the server user's home directory.
</dl>
Either way, the client only needs to do a local disk access to get the
right cookie.  If the client is running as <tt>root</tt>, then that is
no problem.

<p>For an SSH2 proxy, <tt>$XAUTHORITY</tt> will already point to
something like <tt>/tmp/ssh-XXwOjqG6/cookies</tt> on the local host,
which <tt>root</tt> can read, so you should be able to launch X11 apps
as <tt>root</tt> without doing anything special (as long as you keep
this value of <tt>$XAUTHORITY</tt> intact).

<p>Otherwise, you need to set <tt>$XAUTHORITY</tt> to point to the
server user's cookie file.  To do this, use the following (in Bourne
shell syntax):
<blockquote>
<pre>
% XAUTHORITY=~<i>serveruser</i>/.Xauthority
% export XAUTHORITY
%
</pre>
</blockquote>
[I am assuming this is one of the newer Bourne shell implementations
that supports the <tt>csh</tt> "twiddle" (<tt>"~"</tt>) syntax.  -- rgr,
15-Nov-01.]  To see if this is going to work, try
<tt>"xauth&nbsp;list"</tt> from the client account.

<a name = root-can-read>
<h4><tt>root</tt> can copy <tt>~<i>serveruser</i>/.Xauthority</tt></h4>

<p>If you are <tt>"su&nbsp;root"</tt> and <tt>root</tt> can read your
<tt>.Xauthority</tt> file directly, then copying the cookie is a
relatively simple matter.  (Of course, it is not as simple as <a
href="#local-root">inheriting the <tt>$XAUTHORITY</tt> file</a>,
but you would need to copy anyway if you want to subsequently connect to
another host via <tt>rsh</tt> or <tt>telnet</tt> and set
<tt>$DISPLAY</tt> to point back to the original server.)

<p>For this recipe to work, you must be <tt>root</tt>, and one of the
following must be true:
<ul>
  <li> The <tt>~<i>serveruser</i>/.Xauthority</tt> file is on the local
       disk; OR
  <li> The <tt>~<i>serveruser</i>/.Xauthority</tt> file is on a
       partition mounted via NFS with the <tt>no_root_squash</tt>
       option.  (To check this, try
       <tt>"file&nbsp;~<i>serveruser</i>/.Xauthority"</tt>; if you get
       "Permission denied", then try the next recipe.)
</ul>
Either way, copying the cookie poses no additional security risk
(assuming, in the first case, that <tt>root</tt>'s home directory is on
the local machine), since <tt>root</tt> can always get the cookie
anyway.

<p>Here is the recipe for a straight copy:
<blockquote>
<pre>
# whoami
root
# echo $XAUTHORITY

# xauth -f ~<i>serveruser</i>/.Xauthority extract - $DISPLAY | xauth merge -
# 
</pre>
</blockquote>
The first <tt>xauth</tt> invocation takes the cookie for
<tt>"$DISPLAY"</tt> from your <tt>.Xauthority</tt> file; the second one
merges it into that of the current account, which is <tt>root</tt>.  If
this doesn't seem to do anything, <a href="#check-xauthority">check the
value of <tt>"$XAUTHORITY"</tt></a>.  On some systems, you may have to
say <tt>"/usr/bin/X11/xauth"</tt> instead of <tt>"xauth"</tt> in both
places, as <tt>/usr/bin/X11</tt> is not on <tt>root</tt>'s <tt>PATH</tt>
by default.

<p>[Note:  I just tried this on a Solaris 2.6 machine
(<tt>kendrew.bu.edu</tt>, to be specific), and it <tt>chown</tt>'ed the
my <tt>.Xauthority</tt> file to <tt>root</tt>!  Since the permissions on
this file must be 600, this made it impossible for me to open new X11
connections.  Once I <tt>chown</tt>'ed it back to myself, things resumed
working.  I've never had this problem on the Alphas, so it's probably a
vendor/version thing.  -- rgr, 20-Dec-00.]

<p>If <tt>root</tt> is not the client user, but you happen to be running
as <tt>root</tt> (on the right machine) in another shell window, you can
use a slight variation of this recipe to copy directly from
<tt><i>serveruser</i></tt> to <tt><i>clientuser</i></tt>:
<blockquote>
<pre>
# xauth -f ~<i>serveruser</i>/.Xauthority extract - $DISPLAY | xauth  -f ~<i>clientuser</i>/.Xauthority merge -
# 
</pre>
</blockquote>
Since both files are named explicitly, <tt>root</tt>'s value of
<tt>$XAUTHORITY</tt> is irrelevant, but you may need to replace
<tt>"$DISPLAY"</tt> with the correct value for
<tt><i>serveruser</i></tt>'s display.

<a name = root-cannot-read>
<h4><tt>root</tt> cannot read <tt>~<i>serveruser</i>/.Xauthority</tt></h4>

<p>If you are <tt>"su&nbsp;root"</tt> and your home directory is mounted
via NFS with "root squashing" in effect, then <tt>root</tt> won't be
able to read your <tt>.Xauthority</tt> file, so the recipe above won't
work.  In that case, you can regain your priviledge by using
<tt>"su"</tt>, as follows:
<blockquote>
<pre>
% su -c "xauth -f ~<i>serveruser</i>/.Xauthority extract - $DISPLAY" <i>serveruser</i> | xauth merge -
</pre>
</blockquote>
(Before doing this, you may also need to reset <tt>$XAUTHORITY</tt>;
see above.)  This executes the command in quotes:
<blockquote>
<pre>
xauth -f ~<i>serveruser</i>/.Xauthority extract - $DISPLAY
</pre>
</blockquote>
as <tt><i>serveruser</i></tt> in order to read the security file, since
in this case <tt><i>serveruser</i></tt> can do what <tt>root</tt>
cannot.  Ironically, <tt>su</tt> does not ask for a password, since
<tt>root</tt> is always privileged to become anyone else.  And NFS does
not ask for one because it must assume that a process running as a given
user has already authenticated to the local machine's satisfaction.
This shows up the slim security advantage of "root squashing" (though it
is still useful to defend against rogue clients who pretend to be
<tt>root</tt> via NFS without actually having the password).

<a name = unprivileged-local>
<h4>Client account is not privileged, same machine</h4>

<p>In principle, you could use the previous recipe for other user ID's
by making your <tt>.Xauthority</tt> file temporarily world readable, but
a safer tactic (and simpler, since you can do it all in one shell
command) is to use <tt>su</tt> to pipe it to/from <tt>xauth</tt> running
as the other user.  Note that some systems (e.g. Tru64 Unix) do not
permit random users to run <tt>su</tt>.  In this case, using
<tt>ssh</tt> (see <a href="#unprivileged-remote">the next recipe</a>)
should always work.

<p>This recipe is almost the same as the previous one, except that (a)
you have to supply the other user's password, and (b) you may not need
to supply <tt>"-f"</tt> to override the <tt>$XAUTHORITY</tt> variable.
Here is the "pull" version:
<blockquote>
<pre>
% whoami
<i>clientuser</i>
% su -c "xauth extract - $DISPLAY" <i>serveruser</i> | xauth merge -
<i>serveruser</i>'s password: 
% 
</pre>
</blockquote>
The first <tt>xauth</tt> invocation is run under the
<tt><i>serveruser</i></tt> user ID by the <tt>su</tt> command, where it
takes the cookie for <tt>"$DISPLAY"</tt> from that user's default
<tt>.Xauthority</tt> file; the second one merges the cookie into
<tt>~<i>clientuser</i>/.Xauthority</tt>.

<p>The "push" version should work just as well:
<blockquote>
<pre>
% whoami
<i>serveruser</i>
% xauth extract - $DISPLAY | su -c "/usr/bin/X11/xauth merge -" <i>clientuser</i>
<i>clientuser</i>'s password: 
% 
</pre>
</blockquote>
But note that if you needed <a href="#xauthority-env-var">to change the
value of $XAUTHORITY</a>, you will also need to supply
<tt>"-f&nbsp;$old_xauth"</tt> after the first <tt>"xauth"</tt> in the
command line above.

<a name = unprivileged-remote>
<h4>Client account is not privileged, different machine</h4>

<p>In this case, you need to change host and user ID at the same time,
and <a href="ssh.html">SSH (Secure Shell)</a> is the perfect tool for
the job.  Here is the "pull" version:
<blockquote>
<pre>
% whoami
<i>clientuser</i>
% hostname
<i>clienthost</i>
% ssh <i>serveruser</i>@<i>cookiehost</i> /usr/bin/X11/xauth extract - $DISPLAY | xauth merge -
<i>serveruser</i>@127.0.0.1's password: 
% 
</pre>
</blockquote>
The first <tt>xauth</tt> invocation is run under the
<tt><i>serveruser</i></tt> user ID by the <tt>ssh</tt> command, where it
pulls the cookie for <tt>"$DISPLAY"</tt> out of
<tt><i>serveruser</i></tt>'s <tt>.Xauthority</tt> file; the second one
merges the cookie into the default
<tt>~<i>clientuser</i>/.Xauthority</tt> file.  The explicit path on the
first invocation (i.e. using <tt>"/usr/bin/X11/xauth"</tt> instead of
just <tt>"xauth"</tt>) will probably be required; the <tt>$PATH</tt>
environment variable used by <tt>sshd</tt> when running commands doesn't
usually include the X11 executable directory.  If that is the case, then
<tt>"/usr/bin/X11/xauth"</tt> is usually the correct path.  (On systems
using XFree86 (including Linux), <tt>"/usr/bin/X11"</tt> will be a
symlink to <tt>"/usr/X11R6/bin"</tt>, where <tt>xauth</tt> actually
lives.)  If not, you should open an <tt>ssh</tt> connection to that
machine with X11 forwarding enabled, and type
<tt>"which&nbsp;xauth"</tt> in order to find out the exact name.

<p>The "push" version should work just as well:
<blockquote>
<pre>
% whoami
<i>serveruser</i>
% xauth extract - $DISPLAY | ssh <i>clientuser</i>@<i>cookiehost</i> /usr/bin/X11/xauth merge -
<i>clientuser</i>@127.0.0.1's password: 
% 
</pre>
</blockquote>
But note that if you needed <a href="#xauthority-env-var">to change the
value of $XAUTHORITY</a>, you will also need to supply
<tt>"-f&nbsp;$old_xauth"</tt> after the first <tt>"xauth"</tt> in the
command line above.

<h3>Other gotchas</h3>

[this ought to be expanded into a troubleshooting-oriented FAQ.  -- rgr,
15-Nov-01.]

<p>[e.g. when <tt>$DISPLAY</tt> points to the wrong IP address of a
multihomed host; this will work from that host, but when you try to
connect from another machine, the firewall may stop you.  changing
<tt>$DISPLAY</tt> will probably require copying the cookie to the new
host name.  -- rgr, 15-Nov-01.]
