<h2>General information about SSH</h2>

See also the <a href="#info">"Other SSH information sources"</a> section
below.

<a name = what>
<h3>What is SSH, and why care?</h3>

The acronym "SSH" stands for "secure shell," and echoes the Unix command
names <tt>"sh"</tt> (the Bourne shell, the basic command Unix
interpreter) and <tt>"rsh"</tt> (for "remote shell," part of the
Berkeley networking tools and a notoriously <i>in</i>secure way to get a
shell on a remote machine).

<p>SSH is a secure replacement for <tt>rsh</tt> because it provides an
encrypted "tunnel" through which one can log in to a remote host over an
insecure network.  But SSH is in fact more than just a replacement,
because it can use the tunnel to secure other communications as well:
<ul>
  <li> If the <a href="#x11">X Window System</a> is running on your
       local machine, SSH can <a href="#x11">forward X11 connections</a>
       from the server.
  <li> The <a href="#scp"><tt>scp</tt> and <tt>sftp</tt> utilities</a>
       support secure file copying.  (It is not necessary to have an FTP
       server or client on either machine.)
  <li> Arbitrary <a href="#forward">port forwarding</a> is also
       possible.
</ul>
More information on what SSH is and what it does can be found in <a
href="http://www.onsight.com/faq/ssh/">the SSH FAQ</a>.

<a name = notation>
<h3>Notation</h3>

In this document, "SSH" is used in a number of ways.  These are
distinguished typographically as follows:
<ul>
  <li> In caps, SSH refers to the whole tool suite and/or its various
       implementations.
  <li> In lower-case typewriter font, <tt>ssh</tt> is the standard name
       of the client program under Unix.  (<tt>sshd</tt> is the name of
       the "daemon", or server program, by the way.)
  <li> With a number after it (e.g. SSH1 and SSH2), it stands for a
       particular protocol version.
</ul>

<a name = protocols>
<h3>SSH protocol versions</h3>

<p>The first thing you should know about SSH before attempting to use or
install it is that there are two version of the protocol, SSH1 and SSH2,
each of which is available in a number of different implementations.
The two protocol versions are mutually incompatible, so you can't use an
SSH1 client to talk to an SSH2 server.  However, most recent clients
support both protocol versions for compatibility.  So the simplest
algorithm for picking a client version is simply to install a client
that supports version 2.

<p>It may actually be even be simpler than that, as there is a clear
reason to prefer SSH protocol version 2.  A number of exploits for SSH1
were published in February and March of 2001; some of them were known to
be in use by the cracker community as of late October.  (In fact, I saw
two "CRC32 compensation attack" attempts on my home machine during
October 2001.)  Some of the exploits are program bugs in specific
versions, which have been fixed or mitigated, but some are new exploits
for well-known holes in the version&nbsp;1 protocol itself, which are
much harder to address.  The safest way to deal with all of this, in my
opinion, is to avoid using SSH protocol version&nbsp;1 entirely, since
SSH2 was better designed (in the consensus opinion of the security
community -- you don't have to take my word for it).  So, if you ever
need to talk to an SSH1 server, you would be well advised to persuade
the sysadmin to upgrade to version 2.

<p>(Actually, one can sometimes use an SSH1 client to talk to an SSH2
server, but only if the server has been told to use the SSH1 protocol
whenever a version 1 client attempts to connect.  But, for better
security, <i>everybody</i> ought to be using an SSH2 client, which is
why your sysadmin may have already turned off this feature.)

<a name = scp>
<h3>Secure file copying with <tt>scp</tt> and <tt>sftp</tt></h3>

[finish.  -- rgr, 13-Nov-01.]

<p>You can also have both efficiency and security by using
<tt>rsync</tt> over an SSH connection.  See the <a
href="http://rsync.samba.org/rsync/"> <tt>rsync</tt> home page</a> at <a
href="http://rsync.samba.org/rsync/">
<tt>http://rsync.samba.org/rsync/</tt></a> for details.

<a name = forward>
<h3>SSH port forwarding</h3>

<p>SSH can use the same port forwarding magic that it does for X11 with
other TCP-based protocols.  For instance, it is possible to tunnel
<tt>POP3</tt> connections so that your mail client at home can pick up
your mail from work [should find a link for this].  See the <tt>man</tt>
page for details.

<p>Note that FTP doesn't work well this way, since FTP needs to open
other connections in order to actually copy files or directory listing;
you can only encrypt the control connection this way.  That is a help,
since it means you don't have to send an unencrypted password to the FTP
server, but if you want the data transmission to be encrypted as well,
you are better off using <a href="#scp"><tt>scp</tt> or
<tt>sftp</tt></a> instead.

<h3>Other SSH information sources</h3>

<p>General sources of information about SSH are
<ul>
  <li> The "official" SSH home page is <a
       href="http://www.ssh.com/products/ssh/">
       <tt>http://www.ssh.com/products/ssh/</tt></a>, run by SSH
       Communication Security.  (This is a commercial product, developed
       by the original inventor of SSH, but non-commercial users may use
       it for free.)
  <li> The SSH FAQ can be found at <a
       href="http://www.onsight.com/faq/ssh/">
       <tt>http://www.onsight.com/faq/ssh/</tt></a>, among other places.
       (An older version of the FAQ can be found at <a
       href="http://www.faqs.org/faqs/computer-security/ssh-faq/">
       <tt>http://www.faqs.org/faqs/computer-security/ssh-faq/</tt></a>,
       but it appears to be a bit dated now.)
  <li> There is a useful introduction at <a
       href="http://www.tac.nyc.ny.us/~kim/ssh/">
       <tt>http://www.tac.nyc.ny.us/~kim/ssh/</tt></a> that covers
       host-based authentication (i.e. logging in without using
       passwords.
  <li> Once you have it installed locally, you should check out the
       <tt>ssh</tt> man page (for the clients) and the <tt>sshd</tt> man
       page (for the server) to get the final word on the exact version
       you are using.

<h3>Obtaining an SSH client</h3>

You'll need to follow the installation instructions and/or README files
from wherever you download; I won't attempt to duplicate them here.

<dl>
  <dt> <b>Windows:</b>
  <dd> You have many options.  Some of the "pay" options offer a free
       trial for a limited period, typically one month.
       <ul>
	 <li> the SecureCRT shareware product (see <a
	      href="http://www.vandyke.com/products/securecrt/">
	      <tt>http://www.vandyke.com/products/securecrt/</tt></a>);
	 <li> the free PuTTY telnet/ssh client available from <a
	      href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/">
	      <tt>http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/</tt></a>;
	      or
	 <li> F-Secure from F-Secure Corporation (formerly DataFellows);
	      see the <a
	      href="http://www.datafellows.com/download-purchase/">
	      <tt>http://www.datafellows.com/download-purchase/</tt></a>
	      page.
	 <li> X-Win32 from <a href="http://www.starnet.com/">Starnet
	      Communications</a> offers an X11 server for all Windows
	      flavors that comes with F-Secure SSH built in; if you also
	      want to run graphics apps on the Unix box, this is
	      probably your best option.
       </ul>
       See also the <a href="#other-sources">"Other SSH sources"</a>
       listed below.

       <p>
  <dt> <b>Macintosh:</b>
  <dd> There are two free options (NiftyTelnet 1.1 SSH at <a
       href="http://www.lysator.liu.se/~jonasw/freeware/niftyssh/">
       <tt>http://www.lysator.liu.se/~jonasw/freeware/niftyssh/</tt></a>,
       and the MindTerm Java SSH client at <a
       href="http://www.mindbright.se/mindterm/">
       <tt>http://www.mindbright.se/mindterm/</tt></a>), and one
       commercial option (F-Secure again; see "Client (v1.0)" under
       "F-Secure SSH for Macintosh" on <a
       href="http://www.datafellows.com/download-purchase/">
       <tt>http://www.datafellows.com/download-purchase/</tt></a>).
       (There were RSA patent infringement issues with both of these,
       but the patent has since expired, so they may be more readily
       available.)

       <p>
  <dt> <b>UNIX:</b>
  <dd> There are many options for the various flavors of Unix as well.
       I have been running the "portable" version of OpenSSH (see <a
       href="http://www.openssh.org/">
       <tt>http://www.openssh.org/</tt></a>) since April 2001 and am
       quite happy with it.  It is called the "portable" version because
       OpenSSH development is supported by the <a
       href="http://www.openbsd.org/">OpenBSD operating system
       project</a>, with which it is bundled, and so the development
       mainstream is geared toward OpenBSD.  The "portable" version is
       an offshoot that is patched so that it compiles on a large
       variety of other Unix systems; see the "For Other OS's" section
       of the OpenSSH site.  If you want to install OpenSSH from a
       tarball, you will also need <a
       href="http://www.openssl.com/">OpenSSL</a>, and possibly zlib,
       which is stock on (e.g.) Red Hat Linux but not on (e.g.) Tru64.

<h3>Using your SSH client</h3>

On Unix/Linux, type <tt>"ssh <i>username</i>@<i>hostname</i>"</tt>,
where <tt><i>"hostname"</i></tt> is the full name of the SSH server
host, and <tt><i>"username"</i></tt> is the user ID you want to use on
that host.  (And if you can't figure it out for Windows or MacOS, then I
can't help you, for a variety of reasons.  ;-)

<p>When <tt>ssh</tt> first runs, it creates a client key for itself,
since both ends of the connection encrypt/authenticate themselves to the
other party.  When you connect to a host for the first time, it will ask
the host for its public key, and then alarm you by warning about
possible spoofing attacks.  This is a loophole whereby an attacker
pretends to be the server when you first connect, and hands you its key
instead; you would then be delivering your password directly to the
attacker when you attempt to log in.  Meanwhile, the fake server run by
the attacker could then connect as a client to your intended
destination, log in using the password you supplied, and then forward
bytes back and forth between the two connections so that you wouldn't
notice anything wrong.  This is called a "man-in-the-middle" (MITM)
attack, and is mainly theoretical, as it requires a fair amount of
sophistication on the part of the attacker, not to mention great good
luck with timing.  However, "man-in-the-middle" exploit code does exist,
so it is good to take the following simple precautions:
<ul>
  <li> Before you connect to a new machine for the first time, "preload"
       the server key into your client, if possible.  The server's
       public key lives in a file with one very long line somewhere on
       the server machine (in my case,
       <tt>/usr/local/etc/ssh_host_rsa_key.pub</tt>, since the server is
       OpenSSH).  Mail this to yourself and insert it into your
       <tt>~/.ssh/known_hosts2</tt> file prefixed by the host name or IP
       address and a space, keeping it on a single line.  It should look
       something like this (with the actual key truncated):
       <pre>
       rgrjr.dyndns.org ssh-rsa AAAAB3Nz...bmaELj8= root@h0050da615e79.ne.mediaone.net
       </pre>
       (The IP address is a better choice, but not if the host in
       question has a dynamic IP address.)  Note that this is a public
       key, so there is no harm in publishing it.  In fact, companies
       who maintain SSH servers so that their employees can log in from
       home or while on the road would do well to publish their servers'
       public keys on their corporate Web site.

       <p>
  <li> If you can't preload the key, you should at least check that it
       matches after connecting.  The client will tell you that it has
       added a new key to <tt>~/.ssh/known_hosts2</tt> for the host to
       which you just connected; make sure the new value matches the one
       in <tt>/usr/local/etc/ssh_host_rsa_key.pub</tt> on the server.
       (Remember that a man-in-the-middle attacker will in fact connect
       you to your intended destination, but must give you his own
       public key so that he can decrypt the traffic coming from you.
       Therefore, if your client and server are using the same public
       key, there must be a direct connection between you.)
  <li> If you ever get a warning that a host has changed its key,
       proceed with caution.  Normally, it is never necessary to change
       this key, so you might want to try again later.  You can get a
       false alarm when a machine switches to using a different vendor's
       SSH server software, as it will be unaware of the old host key
       and will therefore go ahead and manufacture a new one.  (Upgrades
       between different versions from the same vendor are not a
       problem, as the software tries not to step on an existing host
       key when it installs itself.)  If you believe this is the case,
       go ahead and connect, then compare the public keys as above; if
       they do not match, disconnect and contact your sysadmin
       immediately.
</ul>

<a name=x11>
<h3>SSH and the X Window System</h3>

<p>Without an X Window System (X11) server running on your machine, the
<tt>ssh</tt> client looks like a regular telnet client (with its own
terminal emulator on Windows and Macintosh systems).  You can run
anything you want in the shell, but commands are limited to using the
SSH terminal window as nothing more than a dumb character terminal.  On
the other hand, if you have an X11 session going (i.e. the
<tt>DISPLAY</tt> environment variable is set), then the SSH server sets
<tt>DISPLAY</tt> in the remote session to something that will forward
X11 requests through the SSH connection.  When you start an X-capable
application, e.g. <tt>emacs</tt>, the window will pop up directly on
your screen, just as if you were starting it locally.  Any number of X11
clients can be connected at the same time (though of course they all
have to share the same bandwidth resource as the terminal connection).

<p>X11 over the network is a big win because it allows you to work on
remote Unix systems almost as well as if you were physically there
(modulo bandwidth issues).  But the X11 protocol is notoriously
insecure, as it was designed for LAN use in the "good old days" of
expensive computers with professional sysadmins.  Anyone who can see
your X11 traffic can passively snoop any passwords you type at the
keyboard, and anyone who can actually connect to your X11 server will
have an even easier time of snooping on anything you type.  Hence, the
way the <a href="http://www.openssh.org/">OpenSSH</a> server sets up X11
forwarding is to allow only those connections that
<ol>
  <li> come from the local machine; and
  <li> can show "credentials" that prove it's you.
</ol>
Both are achieved by placing <a href="xauth.html#cookies">the server
cookie</a> in a subdirectory of the <tt>/tmp/</tt> directory on a
local disk drive.  [need more.  -- rgr, 14-Nov-01.]

<p>Note that for X11 forwarding to work, both the client <i>and</i> the
server must be configured to permit it.  Some SSH servers (notably
recent releases of <a href="http://www.openssh.org/">OpenSSH</a>) do not
enable X11 forwarding by default.  Check the <tt>X11Forwarding</tt>
value in the <tt>/usr/local/etc/sshd_config</tt> file on the server (you
will need to be root to change anything in this file), and the
<tt>ForwardX11</tt> value in the <tt>~/.ssh/config</tt> file for the
client.

<p>If you have Linux (or some other flavor of Unix), you've probably
already got X11 for free.  If not, you should consider getting X11:
<ul>
  <li> If you have a Windows machine, you should consider Exceed (the
       commercial industry leader; see <a
       href="http://www.hummingbird.com/products/nc/exceed/index.html">
       <tt>http://www.hummingbird.com/products/nc/exceed/index.html</tt></a>
       or X-Win32 (the upstart competitor; see <a
       href="http://www.starnet.com/products/">
       <tt>http://www.starnet.com/products/</tt></a>).  I have little
       experience with Exceed, but have had success with the X-Win32
       free trial in conjunction with the F-Secure SSH client free
       trial.  (For an extra $94.00, you can buy the F-Secure SSH client
       bundled with X-Win32, which is convenient.)
  <li> If you have a Macintosh system, I've heard good things about the
       <a href="http://www.microimages.com/">MicroImages</a> MI/X X11
       server implementation for the Mac, available for free from <a
       href="http://www.microimages.com/www/html/freestuf/mix/">
       <tt>http://www.microimages.com/www/html/freestuf/mix/</tt></a>.
       (They also have a Windows version for a modest fee.)
  <li> Or check out the vast collection of X11 server reviews and
       products for Windows and MacOS at <a
       href="http://www.rahul.net/kenton/xsites.html">
       <tt>http://www.rahul.net/kenton/xsites.html</tt></a>.
</ul>

<a name=su>
<h3><tt>ssh</tt> and <tt>su</tt></h3>

<p>Since the connection is encrypted, feel free to type passwords for
<tt>"su"</tt> (for example).  But the standard X11 authentication set up
by the SSH server won't allow you to fire up an <tt>xterm</tt>
that displays on your local machine.

<p>[fix missing stuff here.  -- rgr, 14-Nov-01.]

<p>Credentials consist of a "magic cookie" -- essentially a big random
number used as a password -- that must be produced by the connecting
client.  (The actual protocol name is <tt>"MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1"</tt>,
which rather sounds like something Alice might have wanted to eat to
make herself smarter.)  The cookie is initialized by the SSH
server and stored in the <tt>~/.Xauthority</tt> file, which is only
readable by you (or, sometimes, by root).

<p>So there are two ways you can open windows over SSH from
another user account:
<ol>
  <li> You can open a separate SSH connection from your local
       machine for each login.  In order to keep them separate, each
       connection will have a distinct value for the <tt>DISPLAY</tt>
       environment variable, and independent authorization cookies.
       (Multiple connections ought to work from any of the Windows or
       Macintosh implementations, but I haven't tried it myself.)
  <li> You can copy the cookie from your <tt>.Xauthority</tt> file to
       the <tt>su</tt> login's <tt>.Xauthority</tt> file.  You will need
       to do this each time you connect; see the <a href="xauth.html">
       "Using <tt>xauth</tt> to copy cookies"</a> page to find out how.
</ol>

<p>From a security standpoint, both of these techniques are nearly
equivalent.  Your machine is vulnerable to anyone who can log in to any
account that has an open X11 connection.  The "separate connections"
technique has the advantage that once you close the "su" connections,
those users' cookies are obsolete, and can't be used to access the other
display connections.  (Of course, this difference vanishes for the root
account; since root can read any file on the system, you are always
"open" to anyone who can log in as root.)
