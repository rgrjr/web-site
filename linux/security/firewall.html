<h1>An <tt>ipchains</tt> firewall script</h1>

<p><a href="/">Home</a> : <a href="/linux/">Linux</a> : <a
href="">Security</a> : <tt>ipchains</tt> firewall script
<hr>

<p>An old security maxim states that it doesn't pay to be too
forthcoming about your configuration, lest some cracker find a
vulnerability.  While I generally consider this a good idea, I am making
an exception here by publishing my firewall setup scripts.  This is
because I don't want my friends to get zapped by crackers during their
initial explorations of Linux and networking.  Don't believe this is
likely?  Read on.

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>The <tt>firewall</tt> script assumes that there there are two
interfaces that need to be configured:
<ul>
  <li> The external interface, named <tt>eth0</tt> by default, connects
       to the outside world via cable modem and has a DHCP-assigned IP
       address and set of DNS servers.

       <p>
  <li> The internal interface, named <tt>eth1</tt> by default, connects
       to an internal network (namely, Jan's Macintosh) for which the IP
       addresses are fixed private numbers that cannot be used for the
       external Internet.
</ul>
So, there are three basic functions that need to be put in place by this
script:

<ol>
  <li> Connections coming from the outside world must be restricted
       ("firewalling").  This involves denying most connection requests
       from random hosts, without restricting outgoing traffic (except
       for X11 connections, which should never transit public networks
       without some sort of secure tunneling).

       <p>
  <li> All traffic on the internal network must be permitted.  My Linux
       home server is a mail hub and file server.  Strictly, this does not
       require permitting all traffic, but the policy is to trust the
       internal network completely, so if we're running a service, the
       internal network is allowed to use it.

       <p>
  <li> Connections attempts from the internal network to the outside
       world must be handled on behalf of the internal machine ("IP
       masquerading").  This is (a) necessary, because internal machines
       don't have public IP addresses, and (b) desirable, because it
       makes internal machines completely inacessible to crackers
       (unless and until they manage to crack my machine and/or firewall
       first).
</ol>

<p>I wrote this script with the <a
href="http://www.linuxdoc.org/HOWTO/IPCHAINS-HOWTO.html">
IPCHAINS-HOWTO</a> in one hand (the <tt>howto</tt> RPM on Red Hat
distributions installs this into <tt>/usr/doc/HOWTO/IPCHAINS-HOWTO</tt>
if you want a local copy) and the <tt>ipchains</tt> man page in the
other (virtually speaking), stealing idioms from both places.  Much of
the magic involved will become much clearer if you read these,
particularly the overview information.

<p>Note that this pertains solely to the 2.2.x series of kernels.  2.0.x
kernels use something called <tt>ipfwadm</tt>, and the new 2.4.x kernels
use something else again -- I haven't found out what, because I haven't
had a chance to play with 2.4 yet.

<p>It is very unlikely that you would need all of this, so you must edit
the script to reflect your setup.

<h3>Installation of the firewall script</h3>

The scripts themselves are available from the following links:
<ul>
  <li> the <a href="firewall.text"> <tt>firewall</tt></a> script, and
  <li> the <a href="paranoid.text"> <tt>paranoid</tt></a> script.
</ul>

<p>The installation instructions are for Red Hat 6.0; 6.1, 6.2, and 7.0
should be very similar.  Other Linux distributions will vary; consulting
<tt>"man&nbsp;init"</tt> will give you an idea of how much.  BSD
variants are quite different, though conceptually more straightforward.
But I don't know enough to include specific instructions for anything
but Red Hat.

<ol>
  <li> <b>Copy the scripts.</b> As root, save or copy the <a
       href="firewall.text"> <tt>firewall</tt></a> and <a
       href="paranoid.text"> <tt>paranoid</tt></a> scripts into
       <tt>/etc/rc.d/init.d/firewall</tt> and
       <tt>/etc/rc.d/init.d/paranoid</tt>, respectively, and change
       their permissions to 700 (or at least 744; non-super-users can't
       run <tt>ipchains</tt> anyway).

       <p>
  <li> <b>Make your local edits.</b> In particular, make sure that

       <p>
       <ol>
	 <li> the interface names are correct in <b>both</b> scripts;
	 <li> the addresses assigned in the "Interface address
	      definitions" section of <tt>firewall</tt> will work; and
	 <li> connection requests for any services you wish to provide
	      to the Internet are allowed through (search for "Enable
	      this" in the <tt>firewall</tt> script).
       </ol>

       <p>Both scripts are set up to flush all existing
       <tt>ipchains</tt> state, so you can edit a script and rerun it in
       order to redo your setup.  <tt>firewall</tt> will give you a
       "chain already exists" warning for the <tt>ext-in</tt> chain, but
       you can ignore this.  So it's a good idea to run the script after
       editing in order to debug it, and then make sure you can still
       get basic services (ping, DNS, SMTP, HTTP) from the outside
       world.

       <p>
  <li> <b>Get <tt>paranoid</tt> early in the boot process.</b> Add the
       line
       <pre>
       /etc/rc.d/init.d/paranoid
</pre>
       to the end of <tt>/etc/rc.d/rc.modules</tt>, which should be
       empty, or nearly so.  I like to put it here because
       <tt>rc.modules</tt> is called by <tt>rc.sysinit</tt> fairly early
       in the boot process.  Ideally, the firewall should be set up
       before services are launched, but <tt>rc.modules</tt> runs even
       before the interfaces are initialized (and <tt>ipchains</tt>
       doesn't care whether there are any services currently behind the
       ports mentioned).

       <p>
  <li> <b>Find out which run levels enable the network.</b> The
       <tt>/etc/rc.d/init.d/network</tt> script initializes the Ethernet
       interfaces, and conducts DHCP negotiation for interfaces that
       require it, so we can enable the firewall anytime after
       <tt>/etc/rc.d/init.d/network</tt> is run.  Therefore, you need to
       find out which run levels enable the network.  Use the 'find'
       command as follows:
<pre><font size=-1>
    [root@h0050da615e79 /root]# cd /etc/rc.d/
    [root@h0050da615e79 rc.d]# find . -name '???network' -ls
    280638    1 lrwxrwxrwx   1 root     root           17 Jul 24  1999 ./rc0.d/K90network -&gt; ../init.d/network
    305198    1 lrwxrwxrwx   1 root     root           17 Jul 24  1999 ./rc1.d/K90network -&gt; ../init.d/network
    311360    1 lrwxrwxrwx   1 root     root           17 Jul 24  1999 ./rc2.d/S10network -&gt; ../init.d/network
    315470    1 lrwxrwxrwx   1 root     root           17 Jul 24  1999 ./rc3.d/S10network -&gt; ../init.d/network
    323655    1 lrwxrwxrwx   1 root     root           17 Jul 24  1999 ./rc4.d/S10network -&gt; ../init.d/network
    327769    1 lrwxrwxrwx   1 root     root           17 Jul 24  1999 ./rc5.d/S10network -&gt; ../init.d/network
    331826    1 lrwxrwxrwx   1 root     root           17 Jul 24  1999 ./rc6.d/K90network -&gt; ../init.d/network
    [root@h0050da615e79 rc.d]#
</pre></font>
       The output shows that run levels 0, 1, and 6 shut the network
       down, and 2 through 5 enable it.  Therefore, you want to make
       sure that the <tt>firewall</tt> script is run sometime
       thereafter.

       <p>
  <li> <b>Add links to the <tt>firewall</tt> script from the appropriate
       <tt>rc<i>#</i>.d</tt> directories</b> so that <tt>firewall</tt>
       is run after <tt>network</tt>.  Linking <tt>S12firewall</tt> in
       each of the directories for the network-enabled run levels to the
       <tt>firewall</tt> script in <tt>/etc/rc.d/init.d/</tt> will
       guarantee this:
       <pre>
    [root@h0050da615e79 rc.d]# for dir in rc2.d rc3.d rc4.d rc5.d; do
    &gt; ln -s ../init.d/firewall $dir/S12firewall
    &gt; done
    [root@h0050da615e79 rc.d]# 
       </pre>
       The result should look something like this:
<pre><font size=-1>
    [root@h0050da615e79 rc.d]# find . -name '???firewall' -ls
    311401    1 lrwxrwxrwx   1 root     root           18 Mar  5 00:16 ./rc2.d/S12firewall -&gt; ../init.d/firewall
    315644    1 lrwxrwxrwx   1 root     root           18 Mar  5 00:16 ./rc3.d/S12firewall -&gt; ../init.d/firewall
    323768    1 lrwxrwxrwx   1 root     root           18 Mar  5 00:16 ./rc4.d/S12firewall -&gt; ../init.d/firewall
    327816    1 lrwxrwxrwx   1 root     root           18 Mar  5 00:16 ./rc5.d/S12firewall -&gt; ../init.d/firewall
    [root@h0050da615e79 rc.d]# 
</pre></font>
       You don't need any <tt>K<i>??</i>firewall</tt> links in the other
       run levels, because it's not necessary to bring the firewall
       down; bringing the network interfaces down does that just as
       effectively.

       <p>
  <li> <b>Enable IP forwarding.</b> If you want to do forwarding and/or
       masquerading, you need to enable IP forwarding via the following
       magic:
<pre>
       echo 1 &gt; /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
       </pre>
       You can either put this in <tt>rc.modules</tt>, or edit
       <tt>/etc/sysconfig/network</tt> so that
       <tt>/etc/rc.d/init.d/network</tt> does this for you.  (linuxconf
       gives you a GUI for this, but I can't seem to find it now . . .)

       <p>
  <li> <b>Reboot your system to test it out.</b> If you encounter
       serious problems, you can always put <tt>"exit&nbsp;0"</tt> at
       the start of the <tt>firewall</tt> script, comment out the call
       that invokes the <tt>paranoid</tt> script, and reboot; that
       should bring you back to the "native" state.  (But you won't need
       to use this advice, because you carefully tested things at step
       2, didn't you?)
</ol>

<h3>Auditing the logs</h3>

<p>Whenever I tell <tt>ipchains</tt> to deny or reject a packet, I use
the "-l" option, so <tt>ipchains</tt> shows the event in the logs; it
will go into <tt>/var/log/message</tt> unless you have changed
<tt>/etc/syslog.conf</tt>.  (Denial is friendlier than rejection, as the
remote host gets a polite refusal instead of being ignored.)  It is
extremely instructive to take a look at these logs from time to time.
Here's a sample of today's action (with lines wrapped for readability):

<p>128.197.54.63 is <tt>huxley.bu.edu</tt>, a computer I use at <a
href="http://bmerc-www.bu.edu/">work</a>; the connection requests from
<tt>huxley</tt> from 16:24 through 17:08 are me trying to see if I can
get through.  (Some of them, e.g. HTTP on port 80, are ports I hadn't
yet opened at the time but have since put into service.)

<p>The last five lines are a little more troublesome.  Let's look in
more detail.

<p>"PROTO=6" means TCP, so port 1080 is the "socks proxy server"
(according to the list of service names in <tt>/etc/services</tt>; see
also <a href="ftp://ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/iana/assignments/port-numbers">
the list of assigned ports</a>).  This is a Windows service; I'm not
familiar with it, but I understand it's a huge security hole for users
who are unwary enough to leave it open to the Internet.  In any case,
somebody was hoping to connect to an unguarded socket on my machine,
probably looking for a vulnerable port on a random machine.  Here's what
<tt>traceroute</tt> has to say about 208.40.16.81:

Based on <a href="http://www.corecomm.net/">
<tt>www.corecomm.net</tt></a>, this appears to be some random ISP
subscriber (as is almost always the case).  So I would know who to take
my case to if I needed to file a complaint.

<p>The next one is a bit more worrysome.  According to
<tt>/etc/services</tt>, port 27374 is the "Address Search Protocol".  I
don't know what that means, but I've been hit on that port from five
different IP addresses in the last month.  My (revised) guess is that
the "Address Search Protocol" was designed as an internal service, and
these guys were checking to see if I had left this open to the world, in
which case they might be able to get some useful information (for
cracking) out of my machine.  Two of them are on the West Coast
(e.g. from <tt>sfba.home.com</tt>), one from an ISP in area code 661,
and two, including this one, are my MediaOne "neighbors" -- they are
only two hops away:
<pre>
    rgr&gt; /usr/sbin/traceroute 24.147.186.139
    traceroute to 24.147.186.139 (24.147.186.139), 30 hops max, 40 byte packets
     1  wbrtr01-wbswt02-vlan8 (24.128.200.1)  81.514 ms  8.101 ms  7.585 ms
     2  h00e0290f3ce2 (24.147.186.139)  7.755 ms  8.030 ms  7.599 ms
    rgr&gt; 
</pre>
Scary, eh?

<p>And the last guy, 209.235.34.130, is using an off-the-map port,
11011, but may be a little cannier.  I can't use <tt>traceroute</tt> to
figure out where he's coming from, since somebody is filtering out the
ICMP traffic that <tt>traceroute</tt> uses.  [Actually,
<tt>traceroute</tt> seems to work now, and shows that 209.235.34.130
inverse-maps to <tt>ns0.scr3am.com</tt>.  But "scr3am" sounds like a
cracker handle for "scream," so we'd want to complain to the ISP, whom
we can identify as Interliant of Purchase, New York (email to
