<h1>Linux security</h1>

<p><a href="/">Home</a> : <a href="/linux/">Linux</a> : Security
<hr>

<p>This set of pages provides some information on how to run Linux
securely, and is starting to include some more general security
information.  They are not intended to be complete, nor are they
necessarily tutorial in nature.  For more complete information, you
should read at least the latest version of the <a
href="http://www.linuxdoc.org/HOWTO/Security-HOWTO.html"> Linux Security
HOWTO</a>, and consider purchasing a recent book on the subject.

  <dd> A solid firewall is your first line of defense against crackers.
       It is advisable for dialup users, and essential for users of
       high-bandwidth always-on connections (e.g. DSL, ISDN, cable
       modems -- anything faster than 56K), since such machines are more
       attractive as targets.
       [note that Linux kernels now use <tt>iptables</tt>, so this is
       way out of date.  -- rgr, 21-Dec-20.]

  <dd> For logging in to other machines without giving away your
       passwords (or anything else, for that matter).  Also can be used
       to forward connections securely through untrusted networks.  If
       you run an <tt>sshd</tt> (the server) on your home machine, then
       you can log in to it from work, or from anywhere else in the
       world that is equipped with an SSH client, which can be really
       convenient.  However, it is important to keep your SSH server
       up-to-date; one of my friends got his machine cracked this way.
