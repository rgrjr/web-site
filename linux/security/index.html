<p><a href="/">Home</a> : <a href="/linux/">Linux</a> : Security
<hr>

<p>This set of pages provides some information on how to run Linux
securely, and is starting to include some more general security
information.  They are not intended to be complete, nor are they
necessarily tutorial in nature.  For more complete information, you
should read at least the latest version of the <a
href="http://www.linuxdoc.org/HOWTO/Security-HOWTO.html"> Linux Security
HOWTO</a>, and consider purchasing a recent book on the subject.

  <dt> <a href="firewall.html"><b>An <tt>ipchains</tt> firewall
       script</b></a>
  <dd> A solid firewall is your first line of defense against crackers.
       It is advisable for dialup users, and essential for users of
       high-bandwidth always-on connections (e.g. DSL, ISDN, cable
       modems -- anything faster than 56K), since such machines are more
       attractive as targets.
  <dt> <b>Eliminate unnecessary services</b>
  <dd> If you don't need (e.g.) an FTP server, then you can eliminate
       any vulnerabilities related to FTP server bugs by simply not
       running the service.  (And FTP in particular is prone to
       problems; see <a href="http://cr.yp.to/ftp/security.html">
       <tt>http://cr.yp.to/ftp/security.html</tt></a> for an
       exposition.)  [finish.  -- rgr, 30-Apr-00.]
  <dt> <a href="check-logs.html"><b>The <tt>check-logs.pl</tt>
       script</b></a>
  <dd> System log files exist so that sysadmins can track down problems;
       in terms of security, they are also useful for monitoring
       suspicious activity.  Unfortunately, logs are also full of reams
       of useless drivel (that is, until you need some of that drivel to
       diagnose a system problem).  Consequently, most sysadmins wind up
       writing or installing log analysis scripts that sift the logs to
       their satisfaction.  I chose to write my own.
  <dt> <a href="ssh.html">SSH: Secure Shell</a>
  <dd> For logging in to other machines without giving away your
       passwords (or anything else, for that matter).  Also can be used
       to forward connections securely through untrusted networks.  If
       you run an <tt>sshd</tt> (the server) on your home machine, then
       you can log in to it from work, or from anywhere else in the
       world that is equipped with an SSH client, which can be really
       convenient.  However, it is important to keep your SSH server
       up-to-date; one of my friends got his machine cracked this way.
