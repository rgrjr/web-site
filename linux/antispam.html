<h2>Tricks and technologies for dealing with spam</h2>

<p>The first rule of spam-stoppers is that no solution is perfect, but
some are more imperfect than others.  With that in mind, here are some
thoughts on the state of the art.

<h3>What I do now</h3>

<p>In order to cut the flow of spam to an acceptable trickle, I use a
combination of methods:

<dl class="howto">
  <dt> Disposable addresses
  <dd> I have long used special-purpose email addresses to subscribe to
       mailing lists; when the temporary address starts getting spammed,
       I change to a new address.  <a href="qmail.html">The
       <tt>qmail</tt> MTA</a> makes this easy, by giving me an infinite
       supply of addresses I can use.
  <dt> Whitelisting with TMDA
  <dd> The <a href="http://tmda.net/"> Tagged Message Delivery Agent
       (TMDA)</a> is usually configured to accept email only from
       specified "whitelist" addresses, never from "blacklist"
       addresses, and only after confirmation from all others.  See my
       <a href="/bob/tmda.html">Why I use TMDA to reduce spam</a> page
       for why this is so effective.
</dl>

<p>My current "spam rate" is around 50 messages per day, of which 15 are
processed by TMDA, and the rest are for nonworking addresses that are
funneled straight into the bit bucket.  This is based on keeping records
of double-bounces, which happen when the destination address was invalid
so a bounce was generated, but the bounce was undeliverable.  This can
happen directly, as when a spammer sends to a non-existent address, or
indirectly via TMDA.  When TMDA sends a confirmation request, it looks
like a bounce to the mail system, so if the original sender address is
bogus, the confirmation gets double-bounced straightaway.  Finally, I've
sent email for some old addresses that are spammed frequently, usually
mailing list throwaways, straight into the double-bounce logger, since
that reduces the load on my server.

<h3>Discarded solutions</h3>

<p>Here are some things I've tried and discarded:
<dl class="howto">
  <dt> MIME-type filtering.
  <dd> I used to filter out 95% of all spam by
       disallowing HTML email and attachments, and providing a separate
       address for people who wanted to send me attachments, which I
       kept hidden.
       (This was even more effective for viruses, which always have
       attachments these days.)
       But this had two flaws:
       <ol>
	 <li> By December 2003, the total volume of spam had increased
	      such that stopping 95% of it wasn't good enough.
	 <li> The world is full of people who have no clue how to turn
	      off HTML when sending a message -- or even that their mail
	      program sends HTML messages in the first place.
       </ol>
       That's when I decided I had to switch to TMDA.
  <dt> Content-based filtering.
  <dd> Possibly the best-known example of this category is <a
       href="http://spamassassin.apache.org/"> SpamAssassin</a>, which
       looks for telltale features of spam in the message headers and
       body, and produces an estimate of whether it thinks the message
       is spam or not.  I tried this at work, using SpamAssassin to tag
       messages with <tt>"**** SPAM"</tt> in the "Subject:" line, but it
       wasn't very effective, though that may be because the database of
       spam signatures was somewhat old.  I set it up for myself to test
       it without actually blocking anything; for the office
       administrator, we configured her mail reader to quarantine any
       messages with this tag.  But then the office administrator sent
       me an email with "IMPORTANT!!!!" in the subject and the body in
       all-caps.  Not surprisingly, SpamAssassin tagged this as spam,
       which was bad enough, but then the admin didn't see my reply,
       because the subject still had <tt>"**** SPAM"</tt> in it and got
       quarantined!
</dl>

<p>I have not tried any of the commercial spam-filtering solutions,
because they all seem to consist of some kind of content-based
filtering, usually in combination with proprietary technologies.  If the
proprietary technologies were good enough, they wouldn't need the
content filtering, so I'm not inclined to spend the money for what must
be an incremental improvement.  (True, it would be equivalent to hiring
somebody else to maintain the signature database, so it would be more
current and therefore more effective, but I'm leery of false positives.)

<h3>The future of antispam</h3>

<p>There are several other proposals for stemming the flood of spam, but
they tend to be longer term.  They consist of changes to the
infrastructure that make it easier to detect forgeries, but they won't
have much impact until at least one of them is widely implemented.

<dl class="howto">
  <dt> DomainKeys
  <dd> This is a <a href="http://antispam.yahoo.com/domainkeys">Yahoo
       proposal</a> for authenticating the sending domain (but not the
       user).  If an email purported to come from a sending domain whose
       advertised policy is that it <b>always</b> signs outgoing email,
       and the signature was missing or invalid, then the email is
       clearly a forgery, and can be dropped or quarantined.  Once this
       is widely deployed, it could be quite effective; there are ways
       to defeat it, but it would be prohibitively expensive for large
       mass-mailing.
  <dt> ???
  <dd> [There was another similar proposal I read earlier, but I can't
       remember where now.  -- rgr, 10-Dec-04.]
