<h3>General notes</h3>

<p>
<ul>
  <li> My current CD-RW/DVD-ROM is an <a href="http://www.lge.co.kr/">
       LG&nbsp;Electronics</a> model <a
       href="http://www.lgeus.com/Product/CD/gcc_4120b.asp"> GCC-4120
       rev 2.01</a> combination CD-RW and DVD-ROM.  That is, it can read
       and write CD, CD-R, and CD-RW media (audio and data), and read
       DVD and DVD-ROM media (video and data).  This is an ATAPI drive,
       which means (roughly) that it uses SCSI commands over IDE, and
       plugs in using the regular IDE ribbon cable that is common for
       hard drive and CD drives.
  <li> [In case you're curious, it cost me $99 at <a
       href="http://www.pcsforeveryone.com/">PCs for Everyone</a>, my
       favorite hardware shop, located on Charles Street in Cambridge,
       Massachusetts.  -- rgr, 7-Jul-02.]
  <li> In order to get it to work properly as a CD-R drive with my
       oddball Red Hat 6.0/kernel 2.2.19 GNU/Linux system, I needed to
       put <tt>"modprobe&nbsp;ide-scsi"</tt> in
       <tt>/etc/rc.d/rc.modules</tt> to get it to use the correct
       driver.  This broke mounting for reading as <tt>/dev/cdrom</tt>,
       a symbolic link to <tt>/dev/hdc</tt>, so I changed
       <tt>/dev/cdrom</tt> to point to <tt>/dev/scd0</tt> instead.
  <li> All of the software needed to write CDs of various sorts is
       available in the <a
       href="http://www.fokus.gmd.de/research/cc/glone/employees/joerg.schilling/private/cdrecord.html">
       cdrtools</a> package.  For writing data CDs, <tt>mkisofs</tt>
       packages up the files into an ISO9660 CD image, and
       <tt>cdrecord</tt> burns the image onto a blank CD.
  <li> Still scoping out the DVD-player thing.  See the <a
       href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/article.php?sid=5644&mode=thread&order=0">
       GNU/Linux DVD Player Review</a> article for an overview of some
       of the players now available for Linux.
  <li> [for the record, the "KOnCD" utility that comes with KDE has
       problems.  its help file is completely useless.  -- rgr, 3-Jul-01.]

<a name="options">
<h3>Selected <tt>mkisofs</tt> and <tt>cdrecord</tt> options</h3>

This list is far from complete, but a complete list makes a lousy quick
reference.  Do <tt>"mkisofs --help"</tt> if you want to see all options.

<a name="mkisofs-dash-C">
<dl>
  <dt> <b>-C <i>last_sess_start,next_sess_start</i></b><a href=""></a>
  <dd> Used for the second or subsequent session of a multi-session
       CD.  <tt><i>last_sess_start</i></tt> is the sector number of
       the first sector in the last session of the CD to which you
       wish to append, and <tt><i>next_sess_start</i></tt> is the
       starting sector number of the new session.  These numbers may be
       retrieved from the CD via
       <tt>"cdrecord&nbsp;-msinfo&nbsp;..."</tt> [Not clear why this
       needs to be specified if <tt>"-M&nbsp;<i>device</i>"</tt> is also
       specified.  -- rgr, 20-Oct-02.]
  <dt> <b>-f</b>
  <dd> follow symbolic links.
  <dt> <b>-hfs</b>
  <dd> make a Mac filesystem.
  <dt> <b>-l</b>
  <dd> allows 31-char file names.
       <a name="mkisofs-dash-M">
  <dt> <b>-M ( <i>filename</i> | <i>device</i> )</b>
  <dd> Specifies an existing ISO9660 image to be merged in second or
       subsequent session of a multi-session CD, where
       <tt><i>filename</i></tt> is the name of a file that contains an
       ISO9660 image, and <tt><i>device</i></tt> is a <tt>cdrecord</tt>
       "SCSI device specifier," e.g. <tt>"1,0,0"</tt>.  If you do not
       specify this option, then all earlier sessions will seem to have
       vanished from the augmented CD.
  <dt> <b>-max-iso9660-filenames</b>
  <dd> allows 37-char names (by flushing the widely-ignored version
       number feature).
  <dt> <b>--netatalk</b>
  <dd> look for <tt>netatalk</tt>-style <tt>.AppleDouble</tt> directory
       entries.
  <dt> <b>-o</b>
  <dd> specifies the output file.
  <dt> <b>-P</b>
  <dd> specifies the "publisher."
  <dt> <b>-relaxed-filenames</b>
  <dd> removes some file name charset limitations.
  <dt> <b>-V</b>
  <dd> specifies the volume name
</dl>
The rest of the line consists of at least one directory name.

<p>Here is a useful subset of <tt>cdrecord</tt> options:
<dl>
  <dt> <b>-msinfo</b><a href=""></a>
  <dd> Read the session addresses from an existing multisession CD;
       the result is suitable for passing to the <a
       href="#mkisofs-dash-C"><tt>cdrecord</tt> <tt>-C</tt> option</a>,
       and should look something like <tt>"81114,123094"</tt>.  When the
       second number approaches 700&nbsp;000, then the CD is getting
       pretty full.  [Note that <tt>df</tt> seems to report the free
       space for multi-session CDs incorrectly.  On the other hand,
       I'm running the version that came with Red Hat 6.0, which is now
       more than 2.5 years old.  -- rgr, 20-Oct-02.]
  <dt> <b>-multi</b>
  <dd> [finish.  -- rgr, 20-Oct-02.]
  <dt> <b>-waiti</b>
  <dd> This option is needed when piping <tt>mkisofs</tt> to
       <tt>cdrecord</tt> for the second and subsequent track of a
       multi-session CD.  <tt>mkisofs</tt> needs to read directory
       information from the existing CD in order to merge it with the
       new data, so <tt>cdrecord</tt> must be told to wait before trying
       to access the drive.

       The first time I tried this, it only found <tt>scsibus0</tt>,
       which is the symptom of not having the <tt>ide-scsi</tt> driver
       installed for an ATAPI drive.

  <dt> Get <tt>-scanbus</tt> to work in SuSE 9.0 Pro:
  <dd> When I moved the CD-burner to my new SuSE 9.0 machine, which had
       previously only had a CD-ROM drive on it, <tt>cdrecord</tt>
       stopped working, and <tt>-scanbus</tt> could not even find the
       bus.  The symptoms are described in detail in a <a
       href="http://linux.derkeiler.com/Mailing-Lists/SuSE/"> SuSE Linux
       English thread</a> from March 2004 titled "cdrecord stopped
       working".  The solution (suggested by <a
       href="http://linux.derkeiler.com/Mailing-Lists/SuSE/2004-03/0059.html">
       this post</a>) is the following
       <pre>
       cdrecord -scanbus -dev=ATAPI:
       </pre>
       To one of the resulting list of
       <tt>{<i>scsibus</i>,<i>target</i>,<i>lun</i>}</tt> triples, you
       will need to prefix <tt>"ATAPI:"</tt> in order to tell
       <tt>cdrecord</tt> to use the corresponding device, e.g. use
       <tt>"-dev=ATAPI:0,0,0"</tt>.

  <dt> Get drive characteristics:
  <dd> Once you have the proper
       <tt>{<i>scsibus</i>,<i>target</i>,<i>lun</i>}</tt> triple, do the
       following:
       <pre>
       [root@rgrjr /root]# <font color=blue>cdrecord -checkdrive -dev=1,0,0</font>

       [root@rgrjr /root]# 
</pre>
       [The <tt>-inq</tt> flag gets a subset of this information, mostly
       the drive configuration part.  -- rgr, 7-Jul-02.]

  <dt> Put a directory onto a CD (in two steps):
  <dd> Use something like the following:
       <pre>
       mkisofs -f -max-iso9660-filenames -relaxed-filenames -P "Bob Rogers" -V 2003Q1a \
	       -o foo.iso /scratch/backups/2003Q1a/cd/
       cdrecord -speed=8 -dev=1,0,0 -data foo.iso
</pre>
       The first command makes an ISO9660 CD image out of the contents
       of an ordinary Linux directory; the second command writes this
       image to the drive.  It is split up this way into two operations
       because the writing must be done in real time; the CPU has to
       ensure that the data gets to the CD in time to be written.  The
       two operations can be pipelined (see the next item), which
       eliminates the temp hard drive space usage, but doing them separately
       ensures that the CD image is burned correctly onto the blank
       medium.

  <dt> Put a directory onto a CD (in one step):
  <dd> Use a pipeline that looks something like the following:
       <pre>
       mkisofs -max-iso9660-filenames -relaxed-filenames -V 2003Q1a /scratch/backups/cd/2003Q1a \
                | cdrecord -dev=1,0,0 -speed=8 -
</pre>
       This turns out to be much faster for me than doing the two
       steps separately.  The reason is that I have only one hard drive, so
       making a ISO9660 image file from content on the same hard drive
       requires lots of seeks, which are time-consuming.

       <p>The drive is capable of writing a CD-R disk at 4X, 8X, and
       12X, but attempting to write at 12X on my old system results in
       an unreadable CD -- <tt>mount</tt> complains about a bad
       superblock, among other possibilities.  This is probably because
       this machine can't shovel the data fast enough, and so the
       pipeline stalls.  I notice that <tt>xload</tt> shows
       significantly higher CPU demand when writing at 12X than at 8X or
       4X, so perhaps the CPU (a 300MHz Athlon processor) is the
       limiting factor.  My new machine (with a 1.8GHz AMD chip) has no
       problems writing at full speed.

       <p>[add <tt>-hfs --netatalk</tt> to make a Mac-readable CD.  --
       rgr, 22-Sep-02.]

  <dt> Append to a CD: 
  <dd> This requires creating what is called a "multi-session CD."  Each
       session is implemented on what would be considered a "track" on
       an audio disk.  However, note that it is possible to append to a
       CD only if the <em>previous</em> session was written in such a
       way as to allow it.  Therefore, you need to think ahead.

       <p>Usually, both <tt>mkisofs</tt> and <tt>cdrecord</tt> need
       extra instruction on how and whether to write a multi-session CD:
       <ol>
	 <li> <tt>mkisofs</tt> options: On the <em>second and
	      subsequent</em> session image, you must supply the <a
	      href="#mkisofs-dash-C"><tt>-C</tt></a> and <a
	      href="#mkisofs-dash-M"><tt>-M</tt></a> options.  Nothing
	      special is needed for the first session.  However, it is a
	      good idea to use similar options for all sessions, lest
	      <tt>mkisofs</tt> get confused by what's already on the CD.
	 <li> <tt>cdrecord</tt> options: On <em>all but the last</em>
	      session, you must specify the <tt>-multi</tt> option.  If
	      you omit <tt>-multi</tt>, then that will be the last
	      session on the CD.  On the second and all subsequent
	      sessions, you must also specify <tt>-waiti</tt> if piping
	      <tt>mkisofs</tt> output directly into <tt>cdrecord</tt>.
	      (Including <tt>-waiti</tt> for the first session doesn't
	      hurt, though.)
       </ol>

       <p>According to the <tt>cdrecord</tt> <tt>man</tt> page,
       <blockquote>
       The fixation will be done in a way that allows the CD-Recorder to
       append additional sessions later.  This is done by generating a
       TOC with a link to the next program area.  The CD thus written
       is not 100% compatible to manufactured CDs.
       </blockquote>
       [From the version 1.10 description of <tt>"-multi"</tt>, edited
       slightly for readability.  -- rgr, 20-Oct-02.]

       <p>For example, here's a first session being written to a blank
       CD in the drive at logical address <tt>"1,0,0"</tt>:
       <pre>
       mkisofs /scratch/backups/2003Q1a | cdrecord -dev=1,0,0 -speed=8 -multi -
</pre>
       The second and subsequent sessions look like this:
       <pre>
       mkisofs -C `cdrecord -dev=1,0,0 -msinfo` -M 1,0,0 /scratch/backups/test \
            | cdrecord -dev=1,0,0 -speed=8 -multi -waiti -
</pre>
       To write a final session, use something based on the second
       session example but drop the <tt>"-multi"</tt> option.

  <dt> Mount a CD image:
  <dd> This is a useful trick for mounting the data from a CD without
       hogging the drive.  What
       you are mounting will still behave like a CD, though, so you
       won't be able to change its contents.

       <p>First, you need to put the CD in the drive (but don't mount
       it), and then copy the raw CD image onto a file on the hard
       drive:
       <pre>
       dd if=/dev/cdrom of=/scratch/backups/cd-image.iso9660
</pre>
       You may need to substitute <tt>"/dev/cdrom"</tt> with whatever
       the device is named on your system; see <tt>/etc/fstab</tt> for
       hints.  (If you have a USB burner, it will only show up when
       powered on and plugged in.)  Then, mount it wherever you like as
       an ISO9660 file system via a "loop device:"
       <pre>
       mount cd-image.iso9660 /mnt/cdrom -t iso9660 -o loop
</pre>
       See the "THE LOOP DEVICE" section of the <tt>mount</tt>
       <tt>man</tt> page for more details.

<h3> Additional magic for burning DVDs</h3>

Some of this may be peculiar to the DVD burner I use at work, which
<tt>cdrecord</tt> identifies as a MAD DOG 'MD-16XDVD9A2' rev 1.F0.  In
any case, it doesn't handle track-at-once, which is why we need to
specify <tt>-dao</tt> and <tt>-tsize</tt>.

<dl class="howto">
  <dt> Install <tt>cdrecord-ProDVD</tt>:<a href=""></a>
  <dd> [finish.  -- rgr, 10-Jan-06.]

  <dt> Put a directory onto a DVD (in one step):
  <dd> The following recipe seems to work for me:
       <pre>
       to_write_subdir=.
       mkisofs_cmd='mkisofs -max-iso9660-filenames -relaxed-filenames -quiet'

       disk_size=`$mkisofs_cmd -print-size $to_write_subdir`
       $mkisofs_cmd $to_write_subdir \
	   | cdrecord-wrapper.sh -dao -multi -tsize=${disk_size}s -dev=0,0,0 -
       </pre>
       Note that the key thing is to specify <tt>-tsize</tt> to
       <tt>cdrecord-wrapper.sh</tt>, so you need to run <tt>mkisofs</tt>
       with the <tt>-print-size</tt> option, ensuring that you use the
       exact same options in both places.
</dl>

<a name="cd-dump.pl">
<h3>Burning CDs with <tt>cd-dump.pl</tt></h3>

<tt>cd-dump.pl</tt> is a utility that uses <code>mkisofs</code> and
<code>cdrecord</code> to burn files and/or directories to CD.  (Despite
the name, they need not be "dump" files.)  File integrity is verified
after burning and, if the data on the CD is good, the input files are
moved to "written" directory.

<p>Usage for this is
<pre>
    cd-dump.pl [--help] [--man] [--verbose] [--test] 
               [--dev=x,y,z ] [--[no]mount] [--max-iso9660-filenames]
               [--relaxed-filenames] [-V=&lt;volname&gt;] [--speed=n]
               [--to-write-subdir=&lt;directory&gt;] [--written-subdir=&lt;directory&gt;] 
</pre>
See <a href="cd-dump.pl.html">the <tt>cd-dump.pl</tt> <tt>man</tt>
page</a> for argument descriptions, and other details.

<p><b>Downloading:</b>

<p>You will need two things:
<ol>
  <li> The <a href="cd-dump.pl"> <tt>cd-dump.pl</tt> Perl script</a>.
       Download this into a <tt>$PATH</tt> directory
       (e.g. <tt>/usr/local/bin</tt>) and make it executable.
  <li> The <a href="rename-into-tree.pm"> <tt>rename-into-tree.pm</tt>
       Perl module</a>.  Put this in a Perl <tt>@INC</tt> directory
       (e.g. <tt>/usr/lib/perl5/site_perl</tt>).
</ol>
Both of these files contain free software; you may redistribute and/or
modify them under the same terms as Perl itself.  If you only intend to
run <tt>cd-dump.pl</tt> as root, you can put both files in the
<tt>/root/bin</tt> directory.
