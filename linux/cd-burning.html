<h3>General notes</h3>

<p>
<ul>
  <li> All of the software needed to write DVDs and CDs is available in
       the <tt>cdrecord</tt> RPM on <a
       href="https://www.opensuse.org">openSUSE</a>.  For formatting the
       data, the <tt>mkisofs</tt> program (in the <tt>mkisofs</tt> RPM)
       wraps up the files into an ISO9660 image, and <tt>cdrecord</tt>
       burns the image onto a blank disk.
  </li>
</ul>

       If you have built-in SATA drive, it will probably be called

       <tt>/dev/sr1</tt> (if you do).  Since this has been completely
       predictable on my systems, I always add the following line to
       <tt>/etc/fstab</tt> for my USB drive:

       Be sure to create the <tt>/media/dvd</tt> directory if it does

       [The <tt>-inq</tt> flag gets a subset of this information, mostly
       the drive configuration part.  -- rgr, 7-Jul-02.]

  <dt> Put a directory onto a disk (in two steps):
  <dd> Use something like the following:
       <pre>
       mkisofs -f -max-iso9660-filenames -relaxed-filenames -P "Bob Rogers" -V 2003Q1a \
	       -o foo.iso /scratch/backups/2003Q1a/cd/
       cdrecord -speed=8 -dev=1,0,0 -data foo.iso
</pre>
       The first command makes an ISO9660 image out of the contents
       of an ordinary Linux directory; the second command writes this
       image to the drive.  It is split up this way into two operations
       because the writing must be done in real time; the CPU has to
       ensure that the data gets to the CD in time to be written.  The
       two operations can be pipelined (see the next item), which
       eliminates the temp hard drive space usage, but doing them separately
       ensures that the image is burned correctly onto the blank
       medium.

  <dt> Put a directory onto a disk (in one step):
  <dd> Use a pipeline that looks something like the following:
       <pre>
       mkisofs -max-iso9660-filenames -relaxed-filenames -V 2003Q1a /scratch/backups/cd/2003Q1a \
                | cdrecord -dev=1,0,0 -speed=8 -
</pre>
       This turns out to be much faster for me than doing the two
       steps separately.  The reason is that I have only one hard drive, so
       making a ISO9660 image file from content on the same hard drive
       requires lots of seeks, which are time-consuming.
  <dt> Append to a disk: 
  <dd> This requires creating what is called a "multi-session CD."  Each
       session is implemented on what would be considered a "track" on
       an audio disk.  However, note that it is possible to append to a
       CD only if the <em>previous</em> session was written in such a
       way as to allow it.  Therefore, you need to think ahead.

       <p>Usually, both <tt>mkisofs</tt> and <tt>cdrecord</tt> need
       extra instruction on how and whether to write a multi-session CD:
       <ol>
	 <li> <tt>mkisofs</tt> options: On the <em>second and
	      subsequent</em> session image, you must supply the <a
	      href="#mkisofs-dash-C"><tt>-C</tt></a> and <a
	      href="#mkisofs-dash-M"><tt>-M</tt></a> options.  Nothing
	      special is needed for the first session.  However, it is a
	      good idea to use similar options for all sessions, lest
	      <tt>mkisofs</tt> get confused by what's already on the CD.
	 <li> <tt>cdrecord</tt> options: On <em>all but the last</em>
	      session, you must specify the <tt>-multi</tt> option.  If
	      you omit <tt>-multi</tt>, then that will be the last
	      session on the CD.  On the second and all subsequent
	      sessions, you must also specify <tt>-waiti</tt> if piping
	      <tt>mkisofs</tt> output directly into <tt>cdrecord</tt>.
	      (Including <tt>-waiti</tt> for the first session doesn't
	      hurt, though.)
       </ol>

       <p>According to the <tt>cdrecord</tt> <tt>man</tt> page,
       <blockquote>
       The fixation will be done in a way that allows the CD-Recorder to
       append additional sessions later.  This is done by generating a
       TOC with a link to the next program area.  The CD thus written
       is not 100% compatible to manufactured CDs.
       </blockquote>
       [From the version 1.10 description of <tt>"-multi"</tt>, edited
       slightly for readability.  -- rgr, 20-Oct-02.]

       <p>For example, here's a first session being written to a blank
       CD in the drive at logical address <tt>"1,0,0"</tt>:
       <pre>
       mkisofs /scratch/backups/2003Q1a | cdrecord -dev=1,0,0 -speed=8 -multi -
</pre>
       The second and subsequent sessions look like this:
       <pre>
       mkisofs -C `cdrecord -dev=1,0,0 -msinfo` -M 1,0,0 /scratch/backups/test \
            | cdrecord -dev=1,0,0 -speed=8 -multi -waiti -
</pre>
       To write a final session, use something based on the second
       session example but drop the <tt>"-multi"</tt> option.

  <dt> Mount an ISO9660 image:
  <dd> This is a useful trick for mounting the data from a data CD/DVD
       without hogging the drive.  What you are mounting will still
       behave like a CD/DVD drive, though, so you won't be able to
       change its contents.

       <p>First, you need to put the disk in the drive (but don't mount
       it), and then copy the raw disk image onto a file on the hard
       drive:
       <pre>
       dd if=/dev/sr0 of=/scratch/backups/cd-image.iso9660
</pre>
       You may need to substitute <tt>"/dev/sr0"</tt> with whatever the
       device is named on your system; <a href="#find-dev">see above</a>
       for hints.  Then, mount it wherever you like as an ISO9660 file
       system via a "loop device:"
       <pre>
       mkdir -p /mnt/cd-image
       mount cd-image.iso9660 /mnt/cd-image -t iso9660 -o loop
</pre>
       See the "THE LOOP DEVICE" section of the <tt>mount</tt>
       <tt>man</tt> page for more details.

<h3> Additional magic for burning DVDs</h3>

Some of this may be peculiar to the DVD burner I use at work, which
<tt>cdrecord</tt> identifies as a MAD DOG 'MD-16XDVD9A2' rev 1.F0.  In
any case, it doesn't handle track-at-once, which is why we need to
specify <tt>-dao</tt> and <tt>-tsize</tt>.

<dl class="howto">
  <dt> Put a directory onto a DVD (in one step):
  <dd> The following recipe seems to work for me:
       <pre>
       to_write_subdir=.
       mkisofs_cmd='mkisofs -max-iso9660-filenames -relaxed-filenames -quiet'

       disk_size=`$mkisofs_cmd -print-size $to_write_subdir`
       $mkisofs_cmd $to_write_subdir \
	   | cdrecord-wrapper.sh -dao -multi -tsize=${disk_size}s -dev=0,0,0 -
       </pre>
       Note that the key thing is to specify <tt>-tsize</tt> to
       <tt>cdrecord-wrapper.sh</tt>, so you need to run <tt>mkisofs</tt>
       with the <tt>-print-size</tt> option, ensuring that you use the
       exact same options in both places.

<h3>Burning CDs and DVDs with <tt>cd-dump.pl</tt></h3>

<p><tt>cd-dump.pl</tt> is a utility that uses <code>mkisofs</code> and
<code>cdrecord</code> to burn directories to CD or DVD.  (Despite the
name, they need not be "dump" files.)  It is available from Github at
the following link:

<p>The documentation is in the script, and it does not require any
additional Perl code beyond what comes with a standard GNU/Linux
installation.  It can also be installed along with the <a
href="backup.html#backup-scripts"> backup tools in the "scripts"
project</a>.

<h3>Appendix:  Selected <tt>mkisofs</tt> and <tt>cdrecord</tt> options</h3>

This list is far from complete, but a complete list makes a lousy quick
reference.  Do <tt>"mkisofs --help"</tt> if you want to see all options.

       starting sector number of the new session.  These numbers may be
       retrieved from the CD via
       <tt>"cdrecord&nbsp;-msinfo&nbsp;..."</tt> [Not clear why this

  <dt> <b>-M ( <i>filename</i> | <i>device</i> )</b>
  <dd> Specifies an existing ISO9660 image to be merged in second or
       subsequent session of a multi-session CD, where
       <tt><i>filename</i></tt> is the name of a file that contains an
       ISO9660 image, and <tt><i>device</i></tt> is a <tt>cdrecord</tt>
       "SCSI device specifier," e.g. <tt>"1,0,0"</tt>.  If you do not
       specify this option, then all earlier sessions will seem to have
       vanished from the augmented CD.
  <dt> <b>-max-iso9660-filenames</b>
  <dd> allows 37-char names (by flushing the widely-ignored version
       number feature).
  <dt> <b>-o</b>

  <dd> specifies the "publisher."
  <dt> <b>-relaxed-filenames</b>

The rest of the line consists of at least one directory name.

<p>Here is a useful subset of <tt>cdrecord</tt> options:

       and should look something like <tt>"81114,123094"</tt>.  When the
       second number approaches 700&nbsp;000, then the CD is getting
       pretty full.  [Note that <tt>df</tt> seems to report the free
       space for multi-session CDs incorrectly.  On the other hand,
       I'm running the version that came with Red Hat 6.0, which is now
       more than 2.5 years old.  -- rgr, 20-Oct-02.]
  <dt> <b>-multi</b>

  <dt> <b>-waiti</b>
  <dd> This option is needed when piping <tt>mkisofs</tt> to
       <tt>cdrecord</tt> for the second and subsequent track of a
       multi-session CD.  <tt>mkisofs</tt> needs to read directory
       information from the existing CD in order to merge it with the
       new data, so <tt>cdrecord</tt> must be told to wait before trying
       to access the drive.
