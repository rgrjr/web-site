<h3>Setting up a Subversion server using Apache and HTTPS</h3>

Much of this is specific to the details of the SuSE 9.0 configuration.
In particular, I can use Apache 2.0 as distributed by SuSE, but the RPM
edition of Subversion that ships with 9.0 is so old as to be completely
useless, so I needed to build Subversion from the tarball; in my case, I
used Subversion 1.3.0.  Other installations will require larger or
smaller grains of salt.

<h4>Set up Apache <tt>mod_ssl</tt></h4>

<ol>
  <li> Create an SSL certificate.  For testing, I created a self-signed
       cert using a recipe from the OpenSSL <tt>man</tt> page:
       <pre>
       openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:1024 -keyout key.pem -out req.pem
       </pre>
       Then, copy <tt>key.pem</tt> to
       <tt>/etc/apache2/ssl.key/server.key</tt> (this is the private
       key), and <tt>req.pem</tt> to
       <tt>/etc/apache2/ssl.crt/server.crt</tt> (this is the self-signed
       certificate).  Needless to say, I will have to do better if I
       want anyone else to be able to use this.
  <li> Configure Apache 2.0 for SSL.  This consists of (a) copying (or
       renaming) <tt>/etc/apache2/vhosts.d/vhost-ssl.template</tt> to
       <tt>vhost-ssl.conf</tt> (in the same directory), and (b) changing
       <tt>/etc/sysconfig/apache2</tt> to add <tt>"-D&nbsp;SSL"</tt> to
       <tt>APACHE_SERVER_FLAGS</tt> and increase
       <tt>APACHE_START_TIMEOUT</tt> to 10 seconds (so that you have
       time to type in a passphrase).
  <li> Restart Apache via <tt>"/etc/init.d/apache2&nbsp;start"</tt>.
       This requires supplying the passphrase used to protect the server
       private key.
  <li> Verify that SSL is working by visiting the HTTPS version of the
       site.
</ol>

<h4>Build Subversion to use Apache and SSL</h4>

<ol>
  <li> Ensure that the <tt>openssl-devel</tt> and <tt>apache2-devel</tt>
       packages are installed so that Subversion's <tt>./configure</tt>
       script can find their respective header files.
  <li> Configure Subversion as follows:
       <pre>
       ./configure --with-ssl --with-apxs=apxs2 --disable-mod-activation
       </pre>
       These three options have the following effect:
       <p>
       <ul>
	 <li> The <tt>--with-apxs</tt> option requests Apache shared
	      library support; the <tt>"apxs2"</tt> value is necessary
	      for Apache 2.0 under SuSE, where all of the Apache 2.0
	      directories and binaries have a "2" appended.
	 <li> OpenSSL is <b>not</b> autodetected, so an explicit
	      <tt>--with-ssl</tt> is required for "HTTPS" URL support in
	      the client.
	 <li> And <tt>--disable-mod-activation</tt> is necessary in
	      order to tell <tt>apxs2</tt> to skip trying to add
	      "LoadModule" lines to <tt>httpd.conf</tt>; apparently,
	      this is a problem with the SuSE setup.
       </ul>
       &nbsp;
  <li> Do <tt>"make"</tt> to compile.
  <li> As root, do <tt>"make install"</tt>.  (I had to remove the "-a"
       at the end of the <tt>INSTALL_MOD_SHARED</tt> line in the
       generated <tt>Makefile</tt> by hand, because I didn't know I
       needed <tt>--disable-mod-activation</tt> until too late.)
</ol>

<h4>Configure Apache to use <tt>mod_dav_svn</tt></h4>
