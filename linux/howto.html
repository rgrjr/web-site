<a name=glossary>
<h3>Terminology</h3>

<p>In what follows, I've tried to use the following words consistently:
</p>

<ul class="facts">
  <li> <b>Hard drive</b> means just that, though I have a tendency to
       say "disk" instead.  Back when I was introduced to magnetic
       storage, floppies were quite new, so "disk" without qualification
       always meant a rigid disk.  (Probably one with removable media;
       you don't see those anymore, because they can't be made very
       dense, only up to a few hundred megabytes.  Tiny by modern
       standards.)
  </li>
  <li> <b>Disk</b> therefore means <a href="#floppy">floppy disk</a> or
       (rarely) <a href="#zip">zip disk</a>.
  </li>
  <li> <b>DVD</b> covers the fourth kind of disk, which also includes
       CDs.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Networking</h2>

<a name = ether>
<h3>Ethernet</h3>

<p>See my <a href="ether.html">Ethernet Cheat Sheet</a> for Ethernet
pinouts and wire color code conventions.  (This is on a page of its own
for easy printing.)
</p>

<a name = net-gen>
<h3>General IP networking</h3>

<ul>
  <li> The <a href="file:/etc/services"> <tt>/etc/services</tt></a> file
       has the protocol/port to service name mapping.
  </li>
  <li> "netstat -t" reports on open TCP connections. </li>
  <li> Use <tt>"cat /proc/net/dev"</tt> to get a tabular version of
       interface statistics.
  </li>
</ul>

<a name=perl-dns>
<h3>DNS tricks using <tt>perl</tt></h3>

<p>Reverse DNS in <tt>perl</tt>:
<pre>
    rgr&gt; perl -e 'use Socket; $iaddr = inet_aton("128.197.54.20"); print join(" ", gethostbyaddr($iaddr, AF_INET)), "\n";'
    darwin.bu.edu  2 4 \200\3056^T
    rgr&gt; 
</pre>

Reverse DNS from a shell (using perl to trim just the host name out of
the nslookup output):
<pre>
    % nslookup -q=PTR 20.54.197.128.in-addr.arpa | perl -ne 'print "$1\n" if /in-addr.arpa\s+name = (.*)$/;'
    darwin.bu.edu.
    % 
</pre>

<h3>Server logs</h3>

<p>[this does not cover the "modern" <tt>logrotate</tt> package.  --
rgr, 7-Jul-13.]  [or systemd-logger.  -- rgr, 7-Feb-21.]
</p>

<p>The various servers I run keep their log files in the following
places:
</p>

<blockquote>
<table>
  <tr> <th>What</th> <th>Where</th> </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> <tt>dhcpd</tt> </td>
    <td> Uses syslog (<tt>/var/log/messages</tt>).</td>

  <tr>
    <td> <a href="ntp.html"><tt>ntpd</tt></a></td>
    <td> Writes to <tt>/var/log/ntp</tt> via syslog in the default
	 configuration, but this is controlled by the
	 "logfile" directive in <tt>/etc/ntpd.conf</tt>.  (The default
	 tarball installation uses <tt>/var/log/messages</tt>).
    </td> 
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> Apache </td>
    <td> Under openSUSE, the Apache log files are under
	 <tt>/var/log/apache2</tt>.  These are called <tt>access_log</tt>
	 and <tt>error_log</tt>.  If you run an HTTPS server, there will
	 also be an <tt>ssl_request_log</tt> file.
	 [The current log files are sometimes dated; I'm not sure why
	 this happens.  -- rgr, 7-Feb-21.]
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> Subversion </td>
    <td> Subversion runs within Apache, so will need to look in your
	 Apache logs (particularly <tt>ssl_request_log</tt>).
    </td>
  </tr>

<h3>Memory management</h3>

Doing <tt>"cat&nbsp;/proc/meminfo"</tt> generates a report of current
usage.  See <tt>"man&nbsp;vmstat"</tt> for a tool to keep an eye on
memory usage.

<h2>Hardware</h2>

<p>Yes, this is about hardware that is pretty thorougly obsolete, but
all the more reason to keep the "how-to" information around, in case
some day I find old media lying around that I really, really want to
read.  Use a large grain of salt when trying these recipes out, since I
haven't tested them in a while.
</p>

<p>See also the <a href="cd-burning.html">Burning DVDs and CDs</a> page
(which is about hardware that is not so obsolete).

<a name="zip">
<h3>Zip drive</h3>

<dl class="howto">
  <dt> <a name = zip-mount>
       Mounting:
  <dd> Use <tt>"mount&nbsp;/mnt/zip"</tt>.  If this fails with an
       error message that looks like this
       <pre>
       mount: the kernel does not recognize /dev/sda4 as a block device
              (maybe `insmod driver'?)
</pre>
       then this is probably because the machine was booted with the Zip
       drive off.  If that's the case, then
       <pre>
       modprobe imm
</pre>
       will probably be sufficient to get <tt>/dev/sda4</tt> recognized,
       after which the drive can be power cycled without needing to
       repeat the <tt>modprobe</tt>.  (The boot-time <tt>modprobe</tt>
       is done in the <a href="file:/etc/rc.d/rc.modules">
       <tt>/etc/rc.d/rc.modules</tt></a> script.  -- rgr, 28-Dec-99.)

       <p>
       If <tt>/var/log/messages</tt> says
       <pre>
       modprobe: can't locate module block-major-8
</pre>
       and <tt>lsmod</tt> shows <tt>imm</tt> already loaded, then do
       <pre>
       rmmod imm; modprobe imm
</pre>
       to force reloading.  -- rgr, 2-Jul-00.

       <p>
       <a name = zip-unmount>
  <dt> Unmounting:
  <dd> <tt>"umount&nbsp;/mnt/zip"</tt>, and then hit the button to
       eject.  Doing <tt>"eject&nbsp;/mnt/zip"</tt> seems to work, but
       only for root.

  <dt> Formatting:
  <dd> <tt>mke2fs /dev/sda4</tt>

       <a name = no-bad-blocks>
       <p>You can add the <tt>"-c"</tt> option to check for bad blocks,
       but I haven't found a bad block yet, and this is what takes most
       of the time (about 4.5 minutes), as it has to read the entire
       drive.  (My guess is that bad blocks are detected and "repaired"
       by the drive, so it's no surprise that I never found one.  --
       rgr, 7-Aug-01.)

  <dt> Checking for bad blocks:
  <dd> When doing <tt>badblocks</tt> on Zip, use 98288 for number of
       blocks -- this is (- (/ (* 2048 96) 2) 16), for 96 cyl, 2048
       blocks/cyl, 0.5k/block, minus some magic factor.  If there is
       some reason to suspect the existence of a bad block, one can also
       use the <tt>"-c"</tt> option to <tt>e2fsck</tt> when checking
       disk integrity (but see <a href="#no-bad-blocks">the comment
       under "Formatting"</a> above).

  <dt> Checking file system integrity:
  <dd> Periodically, when mounting Zip disks, the following warning will
       appear in <tt>/var/log/messages</tt>:
       <pre>
       EXT2-fs warning: maximal mount count reached, running e2fsck is recommended
</pre>
       To address this, <b>before</b> mounting the disk, do
       <pre>
       e2fsck -f /dev/sda4
</pre>
       The <tt>"-f"</tt> option will "Force checking even if the file
       system seems clean" (from the <tt>man</tt> page); without it,
       <tt>e2fsck</tt> does a quick check, so <tt>"-f"</tt> is more
       thorough.  You can also add the <tt>"-c"</tt> option to request
       bad block checking (but see <a href="#no-bad-blocks">the comment
       under "Formatting"</a> above).

  <dt> Erasing:
  <dd> To erase a Zip disk thoroughly (or any other disk device or
       partition for that matter), you can do a "write" test to check
       for bad blocks:
       <pre>
       badblocks -w /dev/sda4 98288
</pre>
       <p>This takes a while, as it writes a number of patterns across the
       whole disk, and then rereads them.  Each read/write pass takes
       about nine minutes; the whole process is more than half an hour.
       </p>
       <p>[Note that the <tt>shred</tt> program does this exactly this
       job, but more thorougly.  -- rgr, 7-Feb-21.]
       </p>
</dl>

<p>Note the existence of the <tt>mzip</tt> command.

<p>[The "Zip drive backup" section that was here has been renamed and
given <a href="backup.html">its own page.</a> -- rgr, 7-Aug-01.]
