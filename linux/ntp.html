<h1>Automatic system clock setting with NTP</h1>

<p><a href="/"><tt>Home</tt></a> : <a href="index.html">Linux
resources</a> : Automatic clock setting
<hr>

<p>It didn't take me long to get tired of resetting the system clock on
my cheapo PC.  Not only did it drift pretty badly, needing resetting
every three or four weeks in order to keep halfway decent time, but
every time I booted (at least during Daylight Savings Time), the clock
would be off by nearly an hour.  So, in November of 2000, I learned how
to run an <a href="http://www.ntp.org/">NTP time server</a> under Linux.
Since I figured I was not the only one with this problem, I then sat
down and wrote this page.

<a name="intro">
<h2>About NTP and time service in general</h2>

NTP stands for "Network Time Protocol," and is a UDP-based
(i.e. connectionless) protocol for
synchronizing system clocks over the Internet.  With sufficient care
and the right hardware (I am told),
it is possible to synchronize the machines on a local-area network
within tens of microseconds of Universal Time Coordinated (UTC),
the official time kept by standards agencies using atomic clocks.  (For
the truly hard core, version 3 of the NTP protocol itself is described
in <a href="ftp://ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/rfc1305.pdf">RFC1305</a>.)

<p>With the rather minimal effort I have expended, it is possible to
keep the system clock on my very basic AMD K6 within a second of UTC
(worst case), which is far more accuracy than I'll ever need for any
practical reason.  More important, it makes damn sure I'll never ever
have to reset the stupid system clock by hand.  Throughout this document, I
assume that you have similar interests and accuracy requirements.  If
you require greater accuracy, e.g. on the order of milliseconds, or if
you wish to synchronize a subnet of machines, then you'll probably need
to study the <a
href="http://www.eecis.udel.edu/~mills/ntp/html/notes.html">NTP
configuration notes</a> in some detail.

<p>Systems with the most accurate time have at least one interface to a
radio clock that receives timebase signals from a transmitter operated
by one of the aforementioned agencies.  These systems are called
"stratum 1," and any computer that synchronizes itself to one or more
stratum 1 servers is said to operate at stratum 2, and so on for stratum
3 and higher.  Since NTP is a very lightweight protocol, a server at any
level can easily support thousands of simultaneous clients (in other
words, the "fanout"
is high), so it is rarely necessary to go higher than stratum 4.
Stratum 1 servers are not usually available for service to the casual
home computer user, but there are a number of stratum 2 and 3 servers
that are open to the public.  I have set my computer up to provide
stratum 3 service to anyone that requests it.

<a name="installation">
<h2>Installing NTP software</h2>

For several years now, most Unix and GNU/Linux systems have come with
some version of the NTP software installed, so the rest of this section
is for people with older systems; most users can <a href="#synch">skip
to the next section</a>.

<a name="ntp-unix">
<h3>Installing NTP on Unix</h3>

If you are not fortunate enough to have NTP included as part of your
system, you will need to download the tarball and compile it yourself,
but fortunately this is not hard.  Get the latest version from the
download area on the <a href="http://www.ntp.org/">Time Server</a> site
at <a href="http://www.ntp.org/"> <tt>http://www.ntp.org/</tt></a>.  As
of June 2004, the latest production version was 4.2.0, dated
15-Oct-2003.

<p>Installation on Linux is straightforward; it's simply a matter of
doing
<pre>
    ./configure
    make
    make install
</pre>
once you've unpacked the tarball and changed to that directory.  This
installs the following binaries into the <tt>/usr/local/bin</tt>
directory.
<ul>
  <li> <a href="http://www.eecis.udel.edu/~mills/ntp/html/ntpd.html">
       <tt>ntpd</tt></a>
  <li> <a href="http://www.eecis.udel.edu/~mills/ntp/html/ntpdate.html">
       <tt>ntpdate</tt></a>
  <li> <a href="http://www.eecis.udel.edu/~mills/ntp/html/ntpdc.html">
       <tt>ntpdc</tt></a>
  <li> <a href="http://www.eecis.udel.edu/~mills/ntp/html/ntpq.html">

  <li> <a href="http://www.eecis.udel.edu/~mills/ntp/html/tickadj.html">
       <tt>tickadj</tt></a>
</ul>
The links will take you to the HTML equivalent of <tt>man</tt> pages for
each program; these are also included on the tarball.

<a name="other-client">
<h3>Getting an NTP client for other operating systems</h3>

The National Institute of Standards and Technology keeps a <a
href="http://www.boulder.nist.gov/timefreq/general/softwarelist.htm">
Publishers of Time and Frequency Software</a> page with about 50
entries, mostly for Windows, but some for the Macintosh and other more
exotic species.  The <a href="http://www.ntp.org/links.html">links page
on the NTP site</a> has some pointers to other information.

<p>Note, however, that MacOS 8.5 or later (Classic at any rate) already
has a built-in NTP client.  Just go to the "Date &amp; Time" control
panel, and enable it.  They already have the addresses of three Apple
servers built in.  Unfortunately, it only allows you to specify one
server.  And it seems to require numeric IP addresses, which makes it
difficult to use servers such as mine that get their addresses
reassigned periodically.  (The OSX implementation and interface are
probably completely different; I'd bet OSX uses the standard free Unix
NTP software.)

<p>There may be other clients out there as well; you can do a search for
<a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=macintosh+ntp+client">"macintosh
ntp client"</a> or <a
href="http://www.google.com/search?q=windows+ntp+client">"windows ntp
client"</a>, if you're feeling adventurous.

<p>In any case, <i>caveat emptor</i> (if that can be said to apply to
downloaders of free software).

<a name="synch">
<h2>Synchronizing the clock with NTP</h2>

This section addresses NTP configuration, assuming that you have already
downloaded and installed the requisite software.  There are two
approaches:
<ol>
  <li> <a href="#ntpdate">Create a cron job that resets the clock
       periodically</a> from a set of external servers.
  <li> <a href="#ntpd">Run a daemon process that adjusts the clock
       continuously</a>, querying servers as needed to stay on track.
</ol>
The second choice is more accurate, but both are adequate for
maintaining one-second clock accuracy.  Since setup is simpler if the
NTP software comes pre-installed with the distro, it is well worth
checking this first:
<pre>
    rogers@alp&gt; <span style="color: red;">rpm -qa | grep -i ntp</span>
    yast2-ntp-client-2.8.10-26
    xntp-4.1.1-286
    rogers@alp&gt; 
</pre>
On a recent GNU/Linux distro, you should see a package named "ntp" or
"xntp" with a version of 4 or greater.  ("yast2-ntp-client" is a client
configuration interface for the GUI control panel; it's a SuSE thing.)
If not, you may still be able to install this from distribution media,
or from the vendor's Web site.

<p>In any case, before taking either route, you must pick a set of NTP
servers that are willing to provide time service.  Using more than one
server is desirable for the sake of redundancy, in case of host downtime
or network outages.  (Using more than two improves accuracy -- the more
the better, up to a point -- but two servers are quite adequate for
one-second accuracy.)  See the public NTP time server lists
at <a
href="http://support.ntp.org/bin/view/Servers/WebHome">
<tt>http://support.ntp.org/bin/view/Servers/WebHome</tt></a>.  Other
resources are listed on the <a href="http://www.ntp.org/">Network Time
Protocol (NTP) project site</a>.

<p>(I used to offer public time service on
<tt>rgrjr.dyndns.org</tt></a>, but am no longer able to do that, as my
NTP server was being abused for DDOS attacks.  Unfortunately, this is
difficult to prevent.)

<a name="use-dns">
<p>Note that it is best to refer to time servers by domain name, rather
than IP address, since IP addresses are often reassigned.
In fact, a large site may even use an alias (<tt>CNAME</tt> record) such
as <tt>"time.bu.edu"</tt> to point to a designated time server host; the
server can then be moved to a different host with minimal disruption
simply by reassigning the alias.

<a name="builtin-ntpd">
<h3>Adjusting the clock with a built-in NTP daemon</h3>

The following instructions work for YAST2 under <a
href="http://www.suse.com/">SuSE 9.0</a> and subsequent releases.
Something similar is probably provided in other recent GNU/Linux distros;
poking around in the KDE "Control Center" (or the Gnome equivalent) is
probably a good bet.

<p>Under KDE:
<ol>
  <li> Invoke "Control Center" from the "K menu."
  <li> Select "YaST2 modules" =&gt; "Network Services" =&gt; "NTP
       client".  This will required you to supply the root password
       (assuming you are not already logged in as root).
  <li> Tick the selection to start the NTP daemon on boot.
  <li> Click "Add" to add servers one by one.
  <li> Click "Finish" to start.
</ol>
Among other things, this automatically writes <tt>/etc/ntp.conf</tt>,
which can be edited by hand later to resolve problems.

<a name="ntpdate">
<h3>Resetting the clock periodically with <tt>ntpdate</tt></h3>

<p>If you have decided to set via <tt>ntpdate</tt>, then it is best to
do this in two places: In the startup scripts, so that the clock gets
started right when you boot up, and in a <tt>cron</tt> job, so that it
stays right if you keep the machine up for more than a few days.  You
can also run it manually from the command line (as <tt>root</tt>) to set
the clock immediately.

<p>In both places, the command you need is the same:
<pre>
    <a href="http://www.eecis.udel.edu/~mills/ntp/html/ntpdate.html">ntpdate</a> -s server1 [server2 ...]
</pre>
This simply tells <tt>ntpdate</tt> to set the system clock using time
information from the various servers supplied by name on the command
line.  The <tt>-s</tt> option causes <tt>ntpdate</tt> to direct its
output to the system logging facility; if you do not specify this in a
command run by <tt>cron</tt>, the output will be emailed to you, which
is likely to become annoying after a few occurrences.  Of course, you
need to run this as <tt>root</tt> to actually set the clock, though for
testing purposes you can use the <tt>-q</tt> option to <tt>ntpdate</tt>
to query the server(s) as an ordinary user without attempting to set the
time.

<p>The setup procedure is as follows:
<ol>
  <li> Once you have chosen time servers, try <tt>"ntpdate server1
       [server2 ...]"</tt> on the command line to verify that the
       packets can get through in both directions.  If <tt>ntpdate</tt>
       seems to hang, complaining that no servers are usable, but the
       servers all respond to <tt>ping</tt>, then you should read the <a
       href="#client-firewall">"Opening up a firewall for an NTP
       client"</a> section below.
  <li> As root, add the following crontab line:
       <pre>
       30 4 * * *    <a href="http://www.eecis.udel.edu/~mills/ntp/html/ntpdate.html">ntpdate</a> -s server1 [server2 ...]
</pre>
       This schedules the update for every night at 04:30, at which time
       the network should be about as quiet as it gets.  See the <a
       href="#ntpdate-cron">"Resetting the clock periodically via
       <tt>cron</tt>"</a> section for further details.
  <li> Also as root, add <tt>ntpdate</tt> to the correct
       (system-dependent) boot script.  See the <a
       href="#ntpdate-boot">"Using <tt>ntpdate</tt> at boot time"</a>
       section for further details.
  <li> Periodically, you should inspect the system log for messages from
       <tt>ntpdate</tt>.  If <tt>ntpdate</tt> has to change the clock in
       large jumps too frequently (where "large" probably means more
       than a minute), then you might consider increasing the
       frequencing of the cron job.  For instance, replacing the "4" in
       the crontab line above with "4,10,16,22" would cause the update
       to happen four times per day at half past the stated hours.
</ol>

<a name="ntpdate-boot">
<h4>Resetting the clock at boot time with <tt>ntpdate</tt></h4>

<p>The system clock is initialized from the hardware clock by the
<tt>/etc/init.d/boot.clock</tt> script.  (At least this is true in SuSE
8.1 and later; when booting Red Hat Linux 6.x, the system clock is
initialized by <tt>/etc/rc.d/rc.sysinit</tt> instead.)  Unfortunately,
when this runs, the network has not yet been fully initialized, so it is
not possible to query servers.  Instead, it is better to run
<tt>ntpdate</tt> from the <tt>/etc/init.d/boot.local</tt> script (called
<tt>/etc/rc.d/rc.local</tt> in older versions), which is run as the very
last thing when booting up (in run levels 2, 3, and 5, which is
appropriate).  Setting the system clock twice like this may leave it off
by a bit during boot, but the amount by which it is off can be limited
for the next boot by resetting the hardware clock after initializing the
system clock from the NTP servers.  You can do all of this by adding the
following two lines to the end of your <tt>/etc/init.d/boot.local</tt>
script (after replacing the server names):
<pre>
    ntpdate -sb server1 [server2 ...]
    hwclock --systohc
</pre>
The next time you boot, the hardware clock will only be off by the
amount of drift between boots.  (You should first check to see that you
have <tt>hwclock</tt> on your system.)

<p>The <tt>"-b"</tt> option forces the system clock to be set in one
jump, rather than attempting to slew it gradually, and is recommended by
the <a href="http://www.eecis.udel.edu/~mills/ntp/html/ntpdate.html">
<tt>ntpdate</tt> documentation page</a> when booting.

<p>Note that this double clock setting procedure is essentially
equivalent to what the standard boot-time startup scripts for
<tt>ntpd</tt> do, so making the clock jump back and forth at boot time
can't be all that bad.  (It can make the log files harder to decipher,
though.)

<p>Unfortunately, the system boot scripts are very vendor-dependent, so
this recipe may not work for your configuration.  If there is an
<tt>/etc/init.d/rc.local</tt> 2or <tt>/etc/init.d/boot.local</tt> script,
it probably works the same way; otherwise, you will need to figure out
something different for your flavor of Linux/*BSD/etc.

<p><b>[Further disclaimer:</b> Since I need a different setup in order
to run a server, I haven't ever actually tried this startup scheme
myself.  If you find a bug in this "recipe," please let me know.  --
rgr, 24-Nov-00.]

<a name="ntpdate-cron">
<h4>Resetting the clock periodically via <tt>cron</tt></h4>

<tt>"cron"</tt> is the name of the Unix facility for running periodic
jobs.  The "<tt>cron</tt> daemon" is started at boot time, and looks in
"<tt>crontab</tt> files" for instructions.  These files can be examined
and modified via the <tt>crontab</tt> program.  (For more information on
their format, do <tt>"man&nbsp;5&nbsp;crontab"</tt>.)

<p>As <tt>root</tt>, do
<pre>
    crontab -u root -e
</pre>
This will fire up an editor with a copy of <tt>root</tt>'s existing
<tt>crontab</tt> file; you must then add a line for <tt>ntpdate</tt>
that describes when and how to run it.  For example, to run
<tt>ntpdate</tt> daily at 1:23 AM (local time), add the following lines
(after replacing the server names):
<pre>
    # Daily time update at 1:23AM
    23 1 * * *    ntpdate -s server1 [server2 ...]
</pre>
The <tt>"*"</tt>'s in the day-of-month, month, and day-of-week fields
indicate that those time periods should not be consulted when setting
the time.  The <tt>"-s"</tt> option tells <tt>ntpdate</tt> to use the
system logging facilities for messages instead of the standard output,
and is suggested by the <a
href="http://www.eecis.udel.edu/~mills/ntp/html/ntpdate.html">
<tt>ntpdate</tt> documentation page</a> when running <tt>ntpdate</tt> as
a <tt>cron</tt> job.  (Otherwise, the <tt>cron</tt> daemon will send you
the output in what would become a tedious daily email message.)

<p><b>Hint:</b> For best results, you should pick a random time that no
one else is likely to have chosen.  If everybody chose 1:23AM, then once
all clients were synchronized, the servers would suffer a flood of NTP
packets every day at that time, and accuracy would suffer.

<p>Don't forget to save the edited <tt>crontab</tt> file before exiting
the editor.  The next morning, you should examine the log file (probably
<tt>/var/log/messages</tt>) to ensure that <tt>ntpdate</tt> ran
successfully.

<p>For more information, see the <tt>crontab(1)</tt> <tt>man</tt> page,
and for instructions on how to select a different editor.  See the
<tt>crontab(8)</tt> page for more information on the <tt>crontab</tt>
file format.

<a name="ntpd">
<h3>Continuous clock adjustment with <tt>ntpd</tt></h3>

Even if you never offer the service to anyone else, running
<tt>ntpd</tt> will make your clock even more accurate, compared to
calling <tt>ntpdate</tt> as a <tt>cron</tt> job.  That is because
<tt>ntpd</tt> effectively adjusts the clock continuously, as opposed to
just at the <tt>cron</tt> intervals.  And <tt>ntpd</tt> adjustments are
more stable (in the control systems theory sense) because it is in
charge of the adjustment intervals, and can also collect a clock drift
history to use in deciding when and how much to adjust.

<ol>
  <li> Create an <tt>/etc/ntp.conf</tt> file that names your servers.
       Each server should appear on a "server" line by itself, like
       this:
       <pre>
       server server1
       server server2
       . . .
</pre>
       There are many other <tt>ntpd</tt> configuration options, but
       this is all that is necessary to get started.
  <li> Create an <tt>/etc/init.d/ntpd</tt> start/stop script, and link
       it to the appropriate run levels so that <tt>ntpd</tt> starts on
       boot.  (If the NTP tarball doesn't come with something suitable,
       you can start with <a href="ntpd.sh">this
       <tt>/etc/init.d/ntpd</tt> script</a>, which I used to use under
       RedHat 6.x; you'll have to tweak it to get it to work with a
       "modern" GNU/Linux distro.  I don't have an up-to-date version
       because I am now using the SuSE-supported <tt>xntpd</tt>
       package.)
  <li> Do <tt>"/etc/init.d/ntpd start"</tt> to get it going.  This
       should do a <a href="#manual-reset">manual reset</a> before
       starting the server,
  <li> Check the logs for messages confirming that <tt>ntpd</tt> started
       without error.
  <li> You can also do <tt>ntptime</tt> to find out what the kernel
       knows about the current time, but be aware that <tt>ntptime</tt>
       will report an error until the clock is "synchronized," which
       takes about half an hour after the daemon starts.
</ol>

<a name="server">
<h3>Running an NTP server</h3>

Fortunately, this is no harder than <a href="#ntpd">using <tt>ntpd</tt>
to maintain your clock</a>, with the possible exception of <a
href="#server-firewall">punching a hole of the right shape through the
firewall</a>.  Once you have it running, here are some things you can do
to verify that clients can access it:

<ol>
  <li> Before performing client testing, be sure that <tt>ntptime</tt>
       on the client reports synchronization.  Until that happens, the
       server will tell clients not to trust its notion of the time.
  <li> Use <tt>"ntpdate -q"</tt> to verify that the server is listening.
       Do this on the server first, to make sure it's really running,
       and then on the client; if the client can get an answer, then
       you're in business.
  <li> If <tt>ntpdate</tt> fails on the client, use <tt>nmap</tt> to
       determine whether packets can get through to port 123 on the
       server:
       <pre>
       nmap -sU -p123 server1
</pre>
       If this reports that UDP port 123 is open, then you have a client
       problem.
  <li> If <tt>nmap</tt> determines that the port is closed, or doesn't
       get a response at all, then you have a networking problem, which
       could be the fault of the server, the client, or some router in
       between.  First, ensure that basic networking works between
       client and server (i.e. make sure nothing is unplugged).  Then
       perform <tt>nmap</tt> scans at intermediate points until you
       identify the box that is blocking 123/UDP traffic, and configure
       it to let such traffic pass.  Configuring some of these boxes to
       log 123/UDP packets will help pin it down; logging on the server
       itself will tell you whether the query or the response is getting
       lost.
</ol>

<h2>Random tricks</h2>

<dl class="howto">

       that the kernel has lost some timer interrupts while it's dealing

<a name="server-firewall">
<h3>Opening up a firewall for an NTP server</h3>

Fortunately, the NTP server always uses UDP port 123, so it is only
necessary to accept input packets destined from that port, and to permit
outgoing packages coming from that port.

<p>In <tt>iptables</tt>, this is a piece of cake:
<pre>
    iptables -A OUTPUT -p UDP -s `hostname -i` --source-port ntp -j ACCEPT
    iptables -A INPUT -p UDP -d `hostname -i` --destination-port ntp -j ACCEPT
</pre>

However, if you experience startup problems, you should check to see
whether your <tt>/etc/init.d/ntpd</tt> startup script (or
<tt>/etc/init.d/xntpd</tt>) uses the <tt>-u</tt> option to select an
unprivileged port when initializing the system time, which makes it look
like a client.  If so, you must either follow the client instructions
below, or change the startup script to drop the <tt>-u</tt> option.

<h3>Opening up a firewall for an NTP client</h3>

<p>If your NTP client machine is behind a firewall, you need to be sure
that packets to and from remote NTP servers can get through.  When
<tt>ntpdate</tt> queries a server, it sends a series of UDP packets (the
default is four), each of which is addressed to UDP port 123 on the
remote machine and bears a quasi-random source port, call it <i>X</i>,
as the return address on the local machine.  Responses are returned with
a destination port of <i>X</i> on the local machine and a source port of
123 on the remote machine.  In order for the query to succeed, both
packets must be able to traverse the firewall.  If there is outbound
package filtering, it simply needs to let out all UDP packets destined
for port 123 on any machine.  I don't use outbound filtering (except to
block X11 connections).

<p>Inbound filtering is trickier.  If you let through any UDP packet
with a source port of 123, then a cracker could potentially abuse this
by sending UDP packets with a source port of 123 to an arbitrary target
port on your machine.  There are two ways to deal with this:
<ol>
  <li> <b>Restrict incoming IP addresses to just those servers of
       interest.</b>  This certainly narrows the opportunity for abuse
       considerably, but is inconvenient to implement if server
       addresses might change arbitrarily.  And it still allows
       unrestricted access to your UDP ports for users on those
       machines.

       <p>
  <li> <b>Restrict the <i>destination</i> to a non-priviledged port, and
       use the <tt>"-u"</tt> option to <tt>ntpdate</tt> to tell it to
       use only non-priviledged source ports</b> when it sends out
       queries.  By long-standing Unix convention, priviledged ports are
       those below 1024, so this means refusing UDP packets addressed to
       a port below 1024 even if the source port is 123.  But this
       notion of "priviledge" is only a convention and is somewhat
       meaningless for single-user machines, except that it does mean
       that security-critical services such as file service (NFS) and
       remote configuration (BOOTP, SNMP) tend to be implemented on the
       low-numbered ports, especially in the Unix world.
</ol>

<p>Either way, I believe this is not a serious threat.  Most threats to
computer security come in through the TCP ports -- it's hard (but not
impossible!) to craft a useful buffer overflow exploit that fits into a
UDP packet.  However, I still think the issue is worth paying attention
to, since if a UDP-based vulnerability is discovered, it is certain that
many crackers will learn about it before I do.

<p>In order to implement the second option, I have the following line in
my <tt>firewall</tt> setup script:
<pre>
    iptables -A INPUT -p UDP -s 0.0.0.0/0 --source-port ntp \
                      -d `hostname -i` --destination-port 1025: -j ACCEPT
</pre>
This is just an example; it will not work as described above without the
rest of the setup script as well.  And if you choose this route, you
will then need to be careful what services you make available on the
high ports.  Despite the drawback, I prefer this option.
