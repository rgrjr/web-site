<h3>General XML information</h3>

From the introduction on the <a href="http://www.w3.org/XML/">Extensible
Markup Language (XML)</a> page:

<blockquote>
Extensible Markup Language (XML) is a simple, very flexible text format
derived from SGML (ISO 8879).  Originally designed to meet the
challenges of large-scale electronic publishing, XML is also playing an
increasingly important role in the exchange of a wide variety of data on
the Web and elsewhere.
</blockquote>

The first sentence is only half true; nothing derived from SGML can
truly be called "simple."  XML does indeed simplify or eliminate the
hairier SGML features, and is lexically simpler even than HTML.  The
basic concepts are easy, especially if you already know HTML; indeed,
the most important differences between traditional HTML and XHTML, the
new XML-ized version, are what you <emph>can't</emph> do in XHTML that
are valid in HTML.  However, [DTD vs. Schema].

<p>Another reason for complexity is that XML is truly extensible; anyone
can define and publish their own document formats (called an <a
href="#application">"XML application"</a>), and standard tools will be
able to parse and operate on such documents to some extent.  For this to
work, XML needs [metainformation].  So, although it is easy to write
XML, and even to invent your own XML document formats, it is harder to
write the "metadocuments" (such as a DTD or schema) that other tools
will probably need to make sense of the XML.

<p>Unfortunately, all of this information, like XML itself, is fairly
decentralized.  There are about a dozen W3C standards that form what
could be considered the "core" set of XML, with numerous internal
cross-references.  This makes for difficult reading -- even in a Web
browser.  Worse, these standards were written by different working
groups over a period of several years, making it harder to read the
earlier standards without understanding the context in which they were
written.  For example, <a
href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml-names/">Namespaces in XML</a> makes
pervasive changes to the syntax and meaning of names, which had to be
retrofitted into earlier standards.

<p>In order to make sense of it all, it helps to have a good general <a
href="#books">book</a> that covers the XML core concepts in one place.
Even then, it is best to read lightly through it the first time, without
expecting to understand everything, in order to get the big picture.
Then you can fill in the details on the second pass.

<h4>Standards and draft standards</h4>

These are all available from the <a href="http://www.w3.org/">W3C</a> on

<h3>Glossary</h3>

<dl>
       <a name="application">
  <dt> application, XML
  <dd> An "XML application" just means an "application of XML" to a
       given problem area.  It is usually defined by a machine-readable
       DTD that describes the syntax to a validating parser, together
       with a human-readable document that defines the semantics.
       <a name="NCName">
  <dt> <tt>NCName</tt> [<a
       href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml-names/#NT-NCName">Namespaces
       in XML</a>]
  <dd> A "no colon name," used as an identifier.  Such names do not
       belong to any namespace.
       <a name="QName">
  <dt> <tt>QName</tt> [<a
       href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml-names/#NT-QName">Namespaces in
       XML</a>]
  <dd> A "qualified name," with an optional namespace prefix.  Such
       names are generally understood to belong to a namespace.  A
       <tt>QName</tt> has at most one colon, which (if present) must be
       neither the first nor the last character.  Syntactically, this is
       an <a href="#NCName"> <tt>NCName</tt></a> with an optional prefix
       (also an <tt>NCName</tt>).
